R code to run simulations and data analyses for the paper "Oak regeneration facing deer browsing : can competition between saplings offset the diversion effect ? A simulation experiment." by Barrere, J., Ligot, G., Boulanger, V., Collet, C., Courbaud, B., De Coligny, F., Marell, A., Sa√Ød, S. & Balandier, P.

Note that the hypotheses H1 and H2 in the manuscript are respectively referred to as H4 and H3 in the code. 

The simulations are run with the RReShar model, implemented in the [capsis](https://capsis.cirad.fr/capsis/home) modeling platform ([Dufour-Kowalski et al. 2011](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13595-011-0140-9)). The code of all models in capsis is fully public, and can be accessed after downloading capsis. Instruction to download capsis are provided on capsis [website](https://capsis.cirad.fr/capsis/documentation/installation_guide)
