R code to run simulations and data analyses for the paper "Oak regeneration facing deer browsing : can competition between saplings offset the diversion effect ? A simulation experiment." by Barrere, J., Ligot, G., Boulanger, V., Collet, C., Courbaud, B., De Coligny, F., Marell, A., Sa√Ød, S. & Balandier, P.

The simulations are run with the RReShar model, implemented in the [capsis](https://capsis.cirad.fr/capsis/home) modeling platform ([Dufour-Kowalski et al. 2011](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13595-011-0140-9)). The code of all models in capsis is fully public, and can be accessed after downloading capsis. Instruction to download capsis are provided on capsis [website](https://capsis.cirad.fr/capsis/documentation/installation_guide)
