   abstract = {Environmental gradients have been postulated to generate patterns of diversity and diet specialization, in which more stable environments, such as tropical regions, should promote higher diversity and specialization. Using field sampling and phylogenetic analyses of butterfly fauna over an entire alpine region, we show that butterfly specialization (measured as the mean phylogenetic distance between utilized host plants) decreases at higher elevations, alongside a decreasing gradient of plant diversity. Consistent with current hypotheses on the relationship between biodiversity and the strength of species interactions, we experimentally show that a higher level of generalization at high elevations is associated with lower levels of plant resistance: across 16 pairs of plant species, low-elevation plants were more resistant vis-a-vis their congeneric alpine relatives. Thus, the links between diversity, herbivore diet specialization, and plant resistance along an elevation gradient suggest a causal relationship analogous to that hypothesized along latitudinal gradients.},

   abstract = {Climate change is driving latitudinal and altitudinal shifts in species distribution worldwide, leading to novel species assemblages. Lags between these biotic responses and contemporary climate changes have been reported for plants and animals. Theoretically, the magnitude of these lags should be greatest in lowland areas, where the velocity of climate change is expected to be much greater than that in highland areas. We compared temperature trends to temperatures reconstructed from plant assemblages (observed in 76,634 surveys) over a 44-year period in France (1965-2008). Here we report that forest plant communities had responded to 0.54 °C of the effective increase of 1.07 °C in highland areas (500-2,600 m above sea level), while they had responded to only 0.02 °C of the 1.11 °C warming trend in lowland areas. There was a larger temperature lag (by 3.1 times) between the climate and plant community composition in lowland forests than in highland forests. The explanation of such disparity lies in the following properties of lowland, as compared to highland, forests: the higher proportion of species with greater ability for local persistence as the climate warms, the reduced opportunity for short-distance escapes, and the greater habitat fragmentation. Although mountains are currently considered to be among the ecosystems most threatened by climate change (owing to mountaintop extinction), the current inertia of plant communities in lowland forests should also be noted, as it could lead to lowland biotic attrition.},

The selectivity of bark stripping, browsing and fraying damage was analysed. The incidence of damage on forest regeneration varies between 79.8% (class A, height 10-150 cm) in the most severely damaged area to 10.2% in the least affected area. The incidence of damage in each species varies considerably and the tree species most sensitive to browsing damage is the silver fir (Abies alba). Browsing and bark stripping are always highly selective, whilst a difference between red and roe deer was found in relation to fraying damage. The lethality (dead trees/damaged trees) of damage resulting from fraying is important also with low densities, but increases slowly at high densities; the lethality of damage resulting from browsing is nil with low densities of ungulates, whereas it increases rapidly with good correlation when ungulate densities are high.},

   abstract = {The impact of mammalian herbivory on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) sapling performance was quantified in three native forests located in two Mediterranean mountains, the Sierra Nevada and Sierra de Baza (SE Spain). More than 98% of the damage to terminal shoots was caused by goats and Spanish ibex in Sierra Nevada and sheep in Sierra de Baza. Some 72% of the tagged saplings (n = 619) were browsed during at least 1 year of monitoring (1995-1997). There were between-forest differences in herbivory pressure. Moreover, the herbivory pressure was significantly higher during a dry year (1995) than during wet ones (1996 and 1997). Overall, when browsing a sapling, ungulates consumed almost 30% of its apical shoots, and 85% of saplings were browsed more than once after establishment. As a consequence, ungulates severely affected the Scots pine sapling growth rate, and therefore browsed saplings grew slower than saplings unbrowsed by ungulates. Thus, according to exponential growth equations, the time necessary to attain a height threshold to escape from mammalian herbivores (150 cm height in our study forests) and start reproduction was retarded by the herbivory up to 12 years. Ungulates are a major factor hindering the natural regeneration and conservation of the last relict forests of Scots pines in SE Spain. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

   abstract = {Despite the vast diversity and complexity of herbivores, plants and their interactions, most authors agree that a small number of components of leaf quality affect preference by generalist herbivores in a predictable way. However, herbivore preference is determined not only by intrinsic plant attributes and herbivore biology but also by the environmental context. Within this framework, we aimed to analyse general interspecific trends in the association between herbivory and leaf traits over a wide range of angiosperms from central Argentina. We (i) tested for consistent associations between leaf traits, consumption in the field, and preference of generalist invertebrate herbivores in cafeteria experiments; (ii) assessed how well herbivore preferences in cafeterias matched leaf consumption in the field; and (iii) developed a simple conceptual model linking leaf traits, herbivore preference in cafeterias and consumption in the field. In general, we found that tender leaves with higher nutritional quality were preferred by herbivores, both in the field and in cafeteria experiments. According to our model, this relationship between field and cafeteria consumption and leaf quality is observed when generalist herbivores and plants of high accessibility are considered. However, differences between leaf consumption in the field and in cafeteria experiments can also be found. At least two reasons can account for this: (i) specialized plant–herbivore relationships often occur in the field, whereas cafeteria experiments tend to consider only one or a few generalist herbivores; (ii) different plant species growing in the field often differ in their degree of accessibility to herbivores, whereas in cafeteria experiments all species are equally accessible. Our results add new evidence to a growing consensus that, although herbivory in the field is determined by many factors, consistent patterns of differential susceptibility to foliar feeders can be found in leaves differing in nutritional quality and thus in resource-use strategy.},

   abstract = {Aims Woody plant-browser systems represent an understudied facet of herbivory. We subjected four genotypes of trembling aspen to artificial browsing, similar to that of a large mammalian herbivore, and applied deer saliva to clipped and unclipped trees to assess: (i) the effects of artificial browsing on aspen growth and phytochemistry of leaves and stems, (ii) genotypic variation in responses and (iii) potential alterations of responses by mammalian saliva. Methods Potted aspen trees were grown outdoors on the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus. The experiment consisted of a fully-crossed, 2 × 2 × 4 randomized complete block design, with two levels of artificial browsing (unclipped and clipped), two levels of saliva application (no saliva and saliva) and four aspen genotypes. To simulate ungulate browsing damage, we removed the upper 50% of the stem of half of the trees by pinching the stem with needle-nosed pliers and then separating it by tearing. For half of the damaged trees, we immediately swabbed the wound with deer saliva. Trees in the unclipped plus saliva treatment were swabbed with saliva at the 50% height mark. To assess the effects of clipping and saliva application, we harvested all trees after 2 months and measured various growth and chemical properties. Growth measurements included height, vertical growth, mass of leaves, stems and roots, leaf number and area and bud set. Chemical parameters included defensive, nutritional and structural components of both foliage and stems. Important Findings Clipping affected most of the growth parameters measured, decreasing tree height, leaf, stem, root and total tree mass and leaf area. Clipped trees had greater vertical growth, more leaves and higher specific leaf area (SLA) than unclipped trees. Deer saliva had little to no effect on plant growth response to the clipping treatment. Terminal budset was delayed by clipping and varied among genotypes but not in response to saliva application. Clipping also affected most of the phytochemical variables measured, reducing defensive compounds (phenolic glycosides and condensed tannins (CTs)) and nutrients (N), but increasing structural components (cellulose and lignin) in both leaves and stems. Saliva had very little effect on tree chemistry, causing only a slight decrease in the amount of CTs in leaves. In general, leaves contained more defensive compounds and nutrients, but much less cellulose, compared with stems. Genotypes differed for all physical and chemical indices, and in tolerance to damage as measured by vertical growth. In addition, for most of the physical and chemical variables measured, genotype interacted with the clipping treatment, suggesting that in natural stands some genotypes will resist or tolerate browsing better than others, affecting forest genetic composition and ultimately forest dynamics.},

   abstract = {Introduced ungulates can alter understory structure and composition posing a serious threat to forest biodiversity. Yet how large-herbivore impacts in forested regions vary along major environmental gradients remains little explored. If ungulate effects shift with habitat conditions, then management could be tailored to protect most vulnerable forests. We tested the hypothesis that the extent of livestock impact on understory vegetation increases with habitat moisture across Nothofagus dombeyi forests in Nahuel Huapi National Park, NW Patagonia, Argentina. Understory composition and species diversity were compared for paired sites (N = 5), which were historically used by cattle or remained free of livestock for more than 50 yr, and were located along a regional precipitation gradient (1500-2800 mm/yr). Long-term cattle presence reduced the cover of sub-canopy trees, shrubs and bamboo by 57-83%, and increased the relative cover of ground-layer herbs, regardless of habitat moisture. Livestock effects on species composition increased towards the wettest forests, which contained more species exclusive to either browsed or unbrowsed sites. Livestock presence increased species richness (α diversity) and within-site heterogeneity (β diversity) in some locations, but mostly reduced species evenness (30%) throughout the moisture gradient. Species turnover at the gradient scale was lower across browsed sites than for livestock-free sites. Our results indicate that the historical presence of domestic cattle induced region-wide changes in understory communities, highlighting the vulnerable nature of the local flora to ungulate disturbance. The greater impact of livestock browsing on the species composition of wetter forests was consistent with the role of plant growth-defence trade-offs along resource gradients. We suggest that the erosion of understory vegetation attributed to domestic herbivores in Patagonian beech forests can be mitigated by adjusting current animal stocks, while moister forests should be given the highest conservation priority.},

We examined whether winter browsing by deer could increase the resistance of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus). We used three indicators of induced bilberry defence: reduced growth (a), reduced reproduction (b) and decreased insect herbivory (c) in focal plants. In a field experiment, using a randomised block design, we exposed half of plants twice in winter to exogenously applied methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and crossed this factor with randomly selecting browsed and unbrowsed plants. We predicted that MeJA-plants would have significant lower growth, reproduction and insect herbivory than Control plants. We also expected that Browsed plants would experience similar negative effects and that there would be an interaction between MeJa and Browsed indicating a possible additive effect. Growth, flowering and insect herbivory were significantly lower in MeJA than in Control, as expected. We did not find the same reduction for Browsed and no significant interaction between factors. The combined treatment, unexpectedly, flowered more and showed higher levels of insect herbivory than MeJA. Our study showed that defence responses of bilberry may be induced by exogenously-applied MeJA in winter. Our study could not confirm whether winter browsing by deer can induce the same defence responses.},

   abstract = {The moose population in Sweden has undergone large changes during the last decades. This fact has caused concern for both the forestry and hunters. In this study the interactions between the moose population and forest vegetation were investigated. The information on moose population density was collected using questionnaires sent to the managers of county hunting boards in 1987, 1990, and 1992. Data concerning harvesting of moose by hunting were taken from the Swedish National Environment Protection Agency (official statistics), and the data used to analyse forest damage and browsing pressure caused by moose were from the Swedish National Forest Inventory (NFI). The study showed that the moose population increased in Sweden until the winter 1981-1982, when the population was estimated to be 314,000. This corresponds to an average density of approximately 1.1 moose/km2 productive forest land. However, the differences in moose density among counties were large and probably connected to local management strategies and biological conditions. After 1982, the moose population was reduced in many areas, and in 1992 the moose population was estimated to be 225,000. The reduction was caused, to a major part, by increased harvest. There was a significant correlation between reported population changes and registration by the NFl of browsing on preferred tree species and damage in young pine stands. This indicated that the county board advisers had correctly detected population trends and that it is possible to detect changes in a moose population by using a combination of objective browsing and damage inventories. It was, nevertheless, impossible to determine any significant correlation between moose density and damage level. The damaged area of young pine stands per moose varied among counties. Differences in climate, forage coverage, habitat patterns, period of growth etc. were considered to be the main reasons for the variation. There was a significant correlation between the proportion of young pine stands (percent of the total area young forest) and damaged hectares of young pine stands per moose, which shows that the browsing utilisation of pine is closely connected to the available proportion of pine in the total forage bag. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

   abstract = {The effects of moose browsing in young Scots pine stands were studied in southern Finland during 1993-94. The influence of moose on tree species composition starts during the early development of young plantations. A considerable proportion of small pine seedlings was damaged, and hence the future development of the stand was retarded. The average biomass consumption of pine was relatively low increasing slightly with the density of pine seedlings. Browsing of pine was common in the patches with high density of preferred and highly utilized deciduous tree species, aspen and rowan. As elucidated by means of exclosure studies, the availability of tree species preferred and highly utilized by moose, e.g. rowan, is likely to be reduced also by early silvicultural cleaning. Removing excess birches by cleaning appears to be needed even in high-density moose areas to regulate the competition between tree species, especially the birch/pine height ratio. At the present average moose density of 0.4-0.6 km-2 forest land, considerable depletion of highly palatable tree species occurs locally in high-density moose ranges. When optimizing the development of young stands, silvicultural treatment timing and browsing by moose should be taken into account. It is considered important when combining forest and wildlife management to identify the conditions under which damage, overconsumption and possible long-term effects on forest ecosystems take place.},

   abstract = {As herbivory can modulate climate-induced shifts in species distribution, disentangling the relative importance of herbivory and climate on plant growth can help to predict and manage future changes in vegetation, such as those occurring at treeline areas.\n\n\n* An individual-based hierarchical Bayesian time-series model (individual-based model; IBM) was developed to estimate the time-varying impact of climate and herbivory on individual pine sapling height growth in woodland and treeline ecosystems of southern Europe during a 16-year period. The performance of the IBM was compared to a linear mixed-effects (LME) model to test for potential inferential effects when individual variability is marginalized. Time-varying models were also compared to constant parameter approaches.\n\n\n* Model fitting and posterior predictive checking suggests a better statistical performance of individual-scale, time-varying inference. LME modelling overestimated herbivory effects and underestimated environmental stochastic effects, and model validation indeed suggested severe overfitting in the LME model relative to the IBM strategy. These results reveal a potential failure of common aggregation strategies to correctly resolve the effects of climate and herbivory variability at the individual scale. Moreover, ignoring the time-varying nature of the effects may preclude the correct estimation of the temporal scale of climate and herbivory impacts.\n\n\n* In general, we found stronger individual- and time-averaged effects of summer precipitation relative to the effects of herbivory, particularly at the treelines. Also, individual pine responses showed effects of the same sign more consistently in the case of precipitation. This suggests that precipitation is more pervasive at the population level, while herbivory act as a spatially aggregating force through individual-level damage.\n\n\n* Synthesis. Our results suggest that accounting for individual and temporal variability in ecological inference greatly improves the assessment of the relative importance of climate and herbivory on species distribution shifts. Strong effects of precipitation at the treeline could allow tree upward expansion, although increasing ungulate populations and associated browsing damages might limit positive climatic responses of pine saplings in the near future. In this context, the spatially heterogeneous effect exerted by herbivory could result in diverse vegetation structures in ecotones, adding a new dimension to the predictions on climate-driven vegetation shifts.\n\n},

By modifying soil microclimate, tillage exerts the most important control on soil microbial communities. The objective of this study is to assess the effect of tillage on soil microbial biomass and enzyme activities. A meta-analysis was conducted utilizing 139 observations from 62 studies from around the world; the selected effect size (ES) was logn of the response ratio (RR), the mean of the tilled treatment divided by the mean of the no-till control. This ES was calculated for seven different microbial properties - microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN), metabolic quotient (qCO2), fluorescein diacetate (FDA), dehydrogenase (DHA), ??-glucosidase, and urease. Microbial biomass, metabolic quotient and enzyme activities were evaluated due their prevalent usage in evaluation of soil quality and use in soil quality indices. Overall, microbial biomass and all of the enzyme activities were greater under no-till compared to tillage. One exception to this was that under chisel tillage, there was no difference in MBC between the tilled plots and no-till. The qCO2 was greater under tillage than under no-till indicating more active microbes in tilled soil, perhaps compensating for the reduced quantity. In contrast, when looking at only long-term experiments, qCO2 was similar under both tillage and no-till, which may indicate that eventually microbes in no-till plots become as active as those in tilled plots even with the larger microbial community. The findings of this study illustrate that no-till and even reduced tillage, such as chisel tillage, promote larger microbial communities and greater enzymatic activity.},

   abstract = {Common nutrient inputs for containerized nursery crops in the southeastern US include dolomitic limestone to provide calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg); sulfated micronutrients to provide sulfur (S), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu); and controlled release fertilizer (CRF) to provide nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Vermicompost (VC), used as an amendment by some nurserymen, may supply sufficient quantities of some nutrients. The objective of this study was to determine if conventional nutrient inputs could be replaced by commercially available vermicompost (VC) for production of Hibiscus moscheutos 'Luna Blush' L. (hibiscus) in 3.8-L containers. Plants were grown in one of two substrates and provided one of three CRFs. The two substrates were pine bark amended with 11% sand (by vol.), 1.8 kg·m -3 dolomitic limestone, and 0.9 kg·m -3 micronutrient package (PBS) and pine bark amended with 20% VC (by vol.) (20VC). The CRFs were 17-6-12, 17-0-12, and 17-0-0. The four treatments included PBS with 17-6-12 (PBS+NPK), 20VC with 17-6-12 (20VC+NPK), 20VC with 17-0-12 (20VC+NK), and 20VC with 17-0-0 (20VC+N). The PBS+NPK treatment served as the control treatment to represent the industry standard. Plants were grown outdoors in a simulated nursery setting and harvested 8 weeks after potting. Total nutrient plant content was determined by summing the nutrient content by plant partition (root, stem, leaf, and flower bud). Total plant nutrient contents of P, Ca, Mg, S, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, and B were equivalent or greater for all VC treatments compared to PBS+NPK. Therefore, this source of VC replaced the conventional nutrients inputs supplied with dolomitic limestone, micronutrient package, and P in the CRF. Moreover, all three VC treatments averaged 40% greater plant dry weight and 93% more flowers than PBS+NPK. This source of VC can provide all nutrients inputs with the industry standard treatment, with the exception of N and K.},

   abstract = {Solid waste management is one of the challenging problems worldwide and it is becoming more complex by the increase in population and subsequently the waste generated. In Malaysia, among industrial solid waste palm oil mill waste (POMW) contributes the highest share. Wastes from the oil palm mill includes palm oil mill effluent (POME), decanter cake, empty fruit bunches, seed shells and the fibre from mesocarp. Generally most of the waste generated is either disposed of via open dumping or used as fertilizers as such or as animal feed. Land application of POMW and POME is very common practice as it contains numbers of plant nutrients. Direct application of POMW into agricultural soil can result in a number of problems such as water pollution, leaching etc. To deal with these problems, vermicomposting of palm oil mill waste may be a sustainable waste management option. There are number of researches going on management of biomass residues from palm oil mill, but very few works are going on vermicomposting of these agro-industrial waste. Vermicomposting of POMW can be a good practice as it will also be helpful in recycling the useful plant nutrients and it is better than that of composting process. Present review deals with the various aspects of vermicomposting of POMW and its importance. Review also put forward the effect of potential application of vermicompost on plant growth. On the whole it looks for the possibility of vermicomposting of waste from palm oil mill as a sustainable waste management alternative. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {The addition of composted buffalo manure may lead to qualitative and quantitative improvement of the organic matter content of degraded tropical agricultural soils in Northern Vietnam. The objectives of this study were to follow the biochemical changes occurring during composting of buffalo manure with and without earthworms during 3 months and to study the effect of the end products (compost and vermicompost) on soil biochemical parameters and plant growth after two months of incubation under controlled conditions in an open pot experiment. Our conceptual approach included characterisation of organic matter of the two composts before and after addition to soil by elemental, isotopic analysis and analytical pyrolysis and comparison with conventional fertilisation. We also analysed for lignin content and composition. Our results showed that composting in the presence of earthworms led to stronger transformation of buffalo manure than regular composting. Vermicompost was enriched in N-containing compounds and depleted in polysaccharides. It further contained stronger modified lignin compared to regular compost. In the bulk soil, the amendment of compost and vermicompost led to significant modification of the soil organic matter after 2 months of exposure to natural weather conditions. The lignin component of SOM was unaffected whatever the origin of the organic amendment. Compost and vermicompost amendments both enhanced aggregation and increased the amount of organic matter in water stable aggregates. However, vermicompost is preferable to compost due to its beneficial effect on plant growth, while having similar positive effects on quantity and quality of SOM. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Vegetable transplant media used in certified organic crop production must both comply with regulations and meet seedling nutrient demand. Transplant media amendments allowable in organic production often contain complex microbial communities, however little is known about their effects on transplant rhizosphere microorganisms and if these effects carry over to mature plants in the field. To address this, we compared (i) plant-based (sesame meal, alfalfa meal) amendments, (ii) composted manure-based (vermicompost, thermogenic compost, industry standard) amendments and (iii) a non-amended peat and vermiculite base mix for organic tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) production. Organic transplant media amendments affected germination rates, transplant growth in the greenhouse, crop growth in the field and final yields. Transplant biomass and early yield were highest for vermicompost and plant-based amendments. Total yield was highest for 20% alfalfa and sesame meal amendments in the first season, however this high rate of amendment negatively impacted germination. No significant differences in yield were found among amended treatments in the second season where plant-based amendment rates were reduced to1 and 2.5% for sesame meal and 5% for alfalfa meal. Amendments also influenced bacterial community structure in both the transplant media and in the rhizosphere of the tomato plants. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis showed significant differences in bacterial communities between all amendments and these differences persisted for at least one month after seedlings were transplanted to the field. Amendment-associated differences in bacterial communities diminished over the course of the field season. By harvest only vermicompost and the base media had unique T-RFLP profiles. Comparing thermogenic compost and vermicompost made from the same starting material showed that the composting process influenced the bacterial community in the transplant material as well as subsequent communities in the crop rhizosphere. Overall, our results show that the type and rate of organic transplant media amendment can strongly influence transplant quality and subsequent crop performance in the field as well as rhizosphere bacterial communities long after seedlings are transplanted to field soil. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vermicompost has been proposed as a valuable fertilizer for sustainable agriculture. The effects of vermicompost on yield and quality of sweet corn were evaluated in this study. In two field trials, sweet corn plants were grown under (i) a conventional fertilization regime with inorganic fertilizer, and integrated fertilization regimes in which 75% of the nutrients were supplied by the inorganic fertilizer and 25% of the nutrients were supplied by either (ii) rabbit manure, or (iii) vermicompost. All three types of fertilization regime were supplied at two doses. Two pairs of nearly isogenic sweet corn hybrids homozygous for sugary1 and shrunken2 mutants were included in the trials to explore fertilizer × genotype interactions. Growth, yield and ear quality of the plants were evaluated in relation to the three fertilization regimes.\n\nRESULTS: In general, the integrated regimes yielded the same productivity levels as the conventional treatment. Moreover, both vermicompost and manure produced significant increases in plant growth and marketable yield, and also affected the chemical composition and quality of the marketable ear. Nevertheless, most of the observed effects of the organic fertilizers were genotype-dependent.\n\nCONCLUSION: The results confirm that the use of organic fertilizers such as vermicompost has a positive effect on crop yield and quality. Nevertheless, these effects were not general, indicating the complexity of the organic amendment-plant interactions and the importance of controlling genetic variation when studying the effects of vermicompost on plant growth.},

Two locations in the Varanasi district of India were selected as they had been under potato cultivation for the past one decade and the scab pathogen was well established. Among the various treatments, the Pseudomonad strain R1 when applied with vermicompost gave the best plant growth and yield along with maximum reduction in scab incidence and scab index. The strain R1 was later identified as Pseudomonas mosselii. The treatment also showed maximum activities of the antioxidant enzyme peroxidase (POX) and the first enzyme of the phenylpropanoid pathway phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) in a pot experiment till 72. h after pathogen challenge and then declined thereafter. Interestingly the activities of both POX and PAL were higher in the potato tuber peels, the active site of pathogen interaction, than in the potato leaves. The results revealed the potential of P. mosselii strain R1 in promoting plant growth as well as inducing antimicrobial mechanisms systemically in the host plants facilitated by the organic amendment in the form of vermicompost. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

The trial was set up as a factorial experiment with five tree species, four treatment combinations, two irrigation types and two pit sizes. Growth data of five tree species for six parameters (collar diameter, GBH, plant height, crown diameter, number of leaves and number of branches) were recorded over 19 months. Four-way independent ANOVA was conducted on the growth data where all main effects, interaction effects and marginal means were computed. A best fit plantation protocol was developed out of this analysis, with Acacia nilotica and Albizia lebbeck emerging as the best performing tree species. Among different treatments, 20% gypsum along with 10% vermicompost and acid producing bacteria emerged as most preferred treatment amenders. Between two irrigation types, drip irrigation provided better growth results in all the tree species.

Results showed that the highest and the lowest percentages of essential oil were obtained in control (2.9%) and A. chroococcum+vermicompost (2.2%) treatments, respectively. The highest essential oil yield (29.9 L ha-1) and anethole content of essential oil (69.7%) and the lowest contents of fenchone (6.14%), limonene (4.84%) and estragole (2.78%) in essential oil were obtained in compost+vermicompost treatment. It seems that compost+vermicompost treatment compared to other treatments supplied the highest equilibrium of nutrients and water in the root zone of sweet fennel which is led to increasing the anethole content, there upon, decreasing other compounds. Essential oil yield and percentage of anethole content in essential oil were significantly higher in all organic and biological treatments compared with control.\n},

Vermicomposts were prepared from different types of leaves litter of horticulture and forest plant species by modified vermicomposting process at a farm unit. Initial thermophilic decomposition of waste load using cow-dung slurry was done in the separate beds. The culture of Eisenia fetida was used for vermicomposting in specially designed vermibeds at the farm unit. The physico-chemical characteristics, enzyme activities (oxido-reductases and hydrolases), and microbial population (bacteria, fungi, free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria, actinomycetes, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, phosphate-solubilizing bacteria and fungi) of vermicomposts were found significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those of control (without earthworm inoculum). The study quantified significant contributions of earthworm culture to physico-chemical, enzymatic, and microbiological properties of vermicompost and confirmed superior fertilization potential of vermicompost for organic farming. The agronomic utility of vermicompost was assessed on yellow mustard plant in a pot experiment. Pot soil was amended with different ratios (5%, 10%, 20%) of vermicompost and normal compost (without earthworm inoculum). Effects of these amendments on the growth of Brassica comprestis L. were studied. The significant differences (p < 0.05) in the growth of plant were observed among vermicompost-, compost-amended soil, and control. Vermicompost increased the root and shoot lengths, numbers of branches and leaves per plant, fresh and dry weights per plant, numbers of pods and flowers, and biochemical properties of plant leaf significantly, especially in 20% amendment. These results proved better fertilization potential of vermicompost over non-earthworm-inoculated compost.},

Due to the lack of natural occurrence of these plants in the collecting spots in Brazilian northeast, as well as to the absence of information about the natural origin of this material, the introduction from cultured material is strategically important. With this goal, Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation - Tropical Agroindustry (Embrapa Agroindústria Tropical) has introduced 21 accesses of spineless mandacaru, which are multiplied for germplasm conservation and utilization. The aim of this work was to evaluate the multiplication rate of some spineless mandacaru accesses from the Embrapa Agroindústria Tropical Cactaceae Collection, in Fortaleza, Ceará State, Brazil, where this study was conducted. 25 plants were utilized of access 59, 4 plants of access 116 and 4 plants of access 167, materials that were introduced from Fortaleza (Ceará State) and Petrolina (Pernambuco State). The plants (from stem cuttings 30 cm length) were cultured in pots (capacity 5 L), which were filled with fine sand, vermicompost and hydromorphic soil (5:3:2 v/v), conducted at nethouse with 50% of shading for 18 months, watered three times a week (300 ml per pot/watering), supplemented with 50 ml of nutritive solution JADS every 15 days and 50 ml of urea solution (1 g L-1) every 30 days per pot. During the last five months shoot formation per plant and shoot surviving rate after planting were evaluated. The developed shoots were cut when at least 10 cm long, and were planted in pots (capacity 1 L) with the same substrate. At 5 months, the average shoot yields were 3.92; 2.75 and 2.00, respectively, for accesses 59, 116 and 167. All the shoots survived after planting.},

The aim of this work was to evaluate two organic residues that are available in northern Patagonia in Argentina as potential substrate for the production of vegetable seedlings and their behaviour using two cell volumes. Treatments were COC1, COC2, LOC1, LOC2, CCEC1, CCE2 where CO stands for commercial substrate, LO for vermicompost of domiciliary organic waste and CCE for compost of onion residues plus cattle manure; C1 trays with 200 cells of 12 cm(3) each and C2 trays with 128 cells of 22 cm3 each. Lettuce cultivar `Grand Rapids' (Lactuca sativa var. crispa) was sown on two dates: 15/08/07 and 22/08/08. At the first true leave stage plantlets grown in CCEC2 (2007) and COC2 (2008), showed the greatest foliar area while from the first and second leaf stages to the end of the experiments those developed in CCEC2 showed the highest values during the two years the study lasted. For both years at the stage of first true leaf, the highest dry weight values of the different parts of the seedlings were recorded for those that grew in COC1 and COC2. In 2007, the seedlings grown in CCEC2 were the ones for which the greatest weights were recorded during the last growth stage while in 2008 this effect was seen in CO and CCE, regardless of cell volume. During the two years of the experiment at the latest stage, an increase in the root system of the seedlings grown in CCEC2 was observed. The lowest values for these variables were for those seedlings grown in LO. It is concluded that the use of compost of onion residues plus cattle manure in the cells with greatest capacity, offers satisfactory conditions as a substrate.},

The impacts of tea application on the chemical and biological properties of the growth media were also investigated. Vermicompost teas were prepared using various extraction methods (non-aerated, aerated, aerated with additives) with 1 10 (v:v) chicken manure-based vermicompost to water dilution and applied weekly at the rate of 200 mL plant(-1) for 4 weeks. Application of vermicompost tea increased plant production, total carotenoids and total glucosinolates in plant tissue. This effect was most prominent under compost fertilization. Total phenolic was lower in vermicompost tea treated plants compared to those treated with only mineral nutrient solution and the water control. Vermicompost tea improved mineral nutrient status of plants and media, and enhanced the biological activity of the media. Variability in yield and chemical quality of plants across treatments was explained largely by variability in tissue N uptake and dry matter accumulation. Dehydrogenase activity and soil respiration of vermicompost tea-treated growth media were approximately 50% higher than untreated media. This study confirmed that vermicompost tea can positively influence plant yield and quality and increase soil biological activity in multiple soil types.},

There is a possibility, that crop plants are sensitive to negative effect of vermicompost at early stages of development. The aim of the present study was to test the effects of vermicompost on seed germination and seedling growth of different vegetable crop species. Vermicompost substitution inhibited seed germination and seedling growth with almost linear decrease of growth with increasing concentration of vermicopost in the substrate. However, both leaf chlorophyll content and photochemical activity of photosynthesis increased in all crop species with the exception of pea seedlings. Vermicompost extract as a watering solution showed positive effect on growth of bean and pea seedlings. Germination response of vermicompost extract-imbibed seeds was clearly crop species-dependent. Hypocotyl growth was stimulated by low and moderate vermicompost extract concentrations. Radicle growth was more sensitive to negative effect of vermicompost extract. It is reported that both solid vermicompost and vermicompost extract contain number of active substances of both phenolic and humic nature, each with own dose- and genotype- dependent effect of seed germination and early stages of seedling development. Findings of this study suggests that vermicompost must be used cautiously for practical pur- poses of plant propagation.},

Seed germination, size of internode, total length of the plant, leaf area of the plant, tufts of rootlets, which emerged, were measured and recorded. Vermicompost at a concentration of 12.5% was used as source of amendment; treatment was made with endosulfan the concentration of which ranged from 2.5, 5 and 7.5% respectively. From the data obtained after 4 days of treatment, it appeared that the addition of endosulfan in plain soil (7.5%), affects germination to negative value. Reduced germination and plant growth even during prolonged treatment (up to 9 days) was noticed during treatment with 2.5 and 5% of endosulfan. In a soil amended with vermicompost, however, germination to total length of the plant was found to increase quite considerably. This trend has continued, even during extended period of treatment. The entire texture of the plant was found to change to a healthier look in the presence of vermicompost. Better growth of the plant, larger number of rootlets, and bigger leaf area, can be suggested to be additive role of vermicompost on growth and development of Zinnia elegans.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the combined effect of vermicompost and water stress on bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) yield with the hypothesis that vermicompost modifies the soil-plant system and diminishes the effect of water deficit. In greenhouse, the yield of two common bean cultivars (drought-susceptible and tolerant to drought) was assessed in soil with or without 1.5 % and 3 % of vermicompost, with irrigation in the complete cycle and its suspension, starting from flowering. The experimental design was completely randomized with factorial arrangement and five replications. Production of inflorescence, pods, and seeds were evaluated. Under both conditions of irrigation and cultivars, the addition of 3 % of vermicompost increased the total of inflorescence by 31 %, the number of produced pods by 36 %, 16 % that of harvested pods, 34 % in number of seeds and 33 % in seed biomass (yield) per plant. Negative effect of suspending irrigation was observed on the number of pods and seeds and on seed yield; however, with 3 % of vermicompost susceptible and tolerant cultivar increased the number of pods by 17 and 15 %, as well as the amount of seeds by 28 and 48 %, and seed yield by 15 and 50 %. Interactions between factors showed different reaction of cultivars to water stress, vermicompost, and their combination. It was observed that vermicompost in substrate modifies the soil-plant system and diminishes the negative reaction of common bean crops to water stress, since it significantly increases their yield.},

   abstract = {The usefulness of vermicompost as a supporting media for growth of bioinoculants was evaluated for successful transfer of sufficient propagules of bioinoculants into the organic fields. The rooted plants after 50 days were pot and field tested for their growth and yield performances when transplanted along with rooting medium into pots/organic fields. The rooting medium, 50 days of inoculation, contained sufficient population of bioinoculants and arbuscular mycorrhizal (\{AM\}) fungi. Treatment with bioinoculants (except Trichoderma harzianum) substantially improved the root and shoot biomass of nursery raised rooted cuttings particularly in treatments containing Azotobacter chroococcum (150 and 91.67%, respectively), Glomus intraradices (117 and 91.67%, respectively) and Pseudomonas fluorescens (117 and 83%, respectively). The transplanted rooted plants in pots, over two harvests, yielded higher shoot biomass when rooting medium contained A. chroococcum (147%), G. intraradices (139%) and P. fluorescencs (139%). Although the treatments did not affect the content of essential oil, the quality of essential oil as measured by the content of patchouli alcohol improved with Glomus aggregatum (18%). Similar trends were observed in field trials with significantly higher biomass yield achieved with A. chroococcum (51%), G. intraradices (46%) and P. fluorescencs (17%) compared to control (un-inoculated) plots. Increased in herb yield was found to be related with increased nutrient uptake. The population of bioinoculants in the rhizosphere was observed to be considerably higher in plots receiving vermicompost enriched with bioinoculants. This technology can be a successful way of delivering sufficient propagules of bioinoculants along with vermicompost especially in organic fields.},

   abstract = {Soil degradation and water pollution are widespread land degradation problems in Southeast Asia. Policy makers are currently faced with the challenge of designing and implementing strategies to maintain soil fertility and avoid off-site effects. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of organic substrate amendments on soil properties, nutrient leaching and the growth of Ipomea aquatica in an acidic degraded soil from northern Vietnam. Plants were grown in an Acrisol in buckets under natural weather conditions for two months. The same amount of nutrients was applied either in a purely synthetic form (mineral fertilizers) or as two alternative organic substrates (three month old compost or vermicompost from buffalo dung) plus additional amounts of synthetic mineral nutrients to ensure the same quantity of NPK. The influence of these respective substrates on the soil's physical and chemical properties as well as plant growth was examined. Both compost and vermicompost led to an improvement in soil properties with an increase in the pH, soil organic matter and nutrient content, compared to soil fertilized with synthetic mineral products. The highest plant productivity was obtained with vermicompost and synthetic fertilizers, with no significant difference between these two treatments. Chemical fertilization, however, is the least effective practice based on the amount of nutrients leached from the soil (about 38% of N and 22% of K, compared to less than 10 and 5% of N and K with organic amendments). P leaching was not influenced by the fertilizer treatments. In conclusion, vermicompost does appear to be a relevant alternative to chemical fertilizers because it leads to similar enhancements in plant growth, at the same time as increasing soil quality and decreasing nutrient leaching.},

The E.C., total nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, manganese, copper, iron and zinc showed increase in vermicomposts than in the worm un-inoculated composts. The organic carbon, C/N and C/P ratio showed reduction in all the vermicomposts over composts. The results on the growth and yield of paddy with the amendment of vermicompost showed notable increase in 40 kg/plot vermicompost amendment with regular farmers practice. All the parameters considered on the growth and yield of paddy for the study were higher in vermicompost amendments in a dose-dependent manner followed by the regular farmer practice and universal control. The average pH range recorded in all the plots before application of vermicomposts and farmers practice showed slight reduction in vermicompost amended plots after harvesting of paddy. The organic carbon and available NPK contents also showed increase in vermicompost applied plots. The results on the status of microbial population in soils amended with various vermicompost treatments and farmers practice after harvesting of paddy (ADT-37) showed an increase over initial and control plots.

Vermibeds were made using a mixture of herbal waste and cowdung (1 : 1) in comparison with the use of cowdung alone as substrate, resulting in vermicomposts 1 and 2, respectively. Different parameters were studied and it was observed that the nutrient profile of vermicompost 1 strongly influenced the growth of pea (Pisum sativum) and marigold plant (Tagetus erectus). The dry and fresh weight of shoots and roots, number of flowers, total yield in terms of fruit showed significant increase with vermicompost 1. Furthermore, vermicompost 1 (herbal waste and cow dung as substrate) resulted in a significant reduction in TOC by 58% in comparison with vermicompost 2 (cowdung as substrate). The C : N ratio was less than 20 in vermicompost 1 as well as in vermicompost 2, which indicated an advanced degree of stabilization and mineralization. The ability of earthworms to survive, grow and breed in the vermibed fed with the herbal waste indicates the sustainability and efficiency of a heterogeneous kind of organic waste. The results of the study suggested that bulk industrial herbal waste can be utilized as a substrate for vermicomposting and this can be proposed as an alternative for waste disposal in a clean green manner, promoting the concept of organic farming.},

Throughout the test period regular chl a fluorescence measurements were taken and subjected to JIP-test quantifying changes in photosynthetic vitality status. Additionally, growth measurements and one-off leaf analysis were carried out. Test plants growing on mine tailings experienced an up to 35% higher average photosynthetic vitality (PIABS) and improved nutrient supply, when treated with mature sewage sludge. Consequently, sewage sludge treated plants showed a higher biomass build-up rate and an up to 55% higher diameter growth, compared to control. In summary the experiments present a low cost alternative for reforestation enterprises on platinum and gold tailings dams in South Africa.},

Average maximum fruit yield for the rainy and winter season crop was 38.2 and 19.0 kg/tree respectively, with 250 g Azotobactor + 20 kg FYM. Vermicompost (20 kg/tree) had significantly higher yield over control and was recommended as the third best treatment among all regarding the yield. Highest fruit weight 198.2 and 299.2 g, fruit length 5.9 and 7.2 cm and fruit breadth 7.0 and 7.4 cm for rainy and winter season crop, respectively, were obtained with the application of Phosphobacterin (50 ml/tree), which was, however, at par with that obtained with Vesicular Arbuscular Mycorrhiza (VAM, 10 kg/tree). Highest total soluble solids (16.1 and 17.9 degrees Brix) for rainy and winter season crop, respectively, as well as vitamin C (189.6 mg/100 g) was obtained with the application of VAM. Acidity was not influenced by the application of bio-fertilizer. However, acidity was highest (0.54%) under FYM treatment. From the present study, it can be concluded that the application of bio-fertilizer was more effective than organic manures in enhancing fruit growth parameters in guava in both seasons. When bio-fertilizers were grouped together, P-solubilizers were found to have more beneficial influence on fruit physico-chemical characteristics of 'Red Fleshed' guava as compared to N-fixers.},

Organic matter, CEC and nutrients available (N, P and K) were increased as the rate of the organic materials increased. The treatment of vermicompost: WTR (2:1 wet weight ratio) at level of 10 g kg-1 soil gave the highest grain weight of barley plants compared to other treatments. Based on the results of the current study, the combinations of vermicompost and WTR can are considered as an ameliorating material to reclaim of salt-affected soils and to improve the yield of barley plants.

   abstract = {Optimization of growth, yield and quality of vegetable crops in an integrated manner is achievable through efficient use of organic, inorganic and biological sources of nutrients. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of foliar or soil application of humic and bio-fertilizers, on the growth and yield of greenhouse tomatoes. The experiment was carried out during three consecutive years in an unheated greenhouse at Maritsa Vegetable Crops Research Institute, Bulgaria. A commercially available humic fertilizer, produced from vermicompost, and biofertilizer, containing Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus lactis, Phodopseudomonas palistris, Saccharomices cerevisiae were tested. Soil application of both fertilizers was performed only once, a week after transplanting, while the foliar application was conducted three times with 10-14 day intervals after transplanting. In order to assure uniform background of the experimental plots, the soil was supplemented with mineral fertilizers according to the recommendations following the soil analysis. The results indicated that soil application of both fertilizers stimulated the growth of tomato plants. The total tomato yield was increased with 19 and 21% after soil application and by 13 and 14% after foliar application of bio-fertilizer and humic fertilizer, respectively. The enhancement of the total yield was attributed to the enhancement of the mean fruit weight, which increased by 14-30 g per fruit. The early yield and the number of fruits per plant were not influenced by the applied humic or bio-fertilizers. The results indicated that the utilization of bio-fertilizer or humic fertilizer in fertilization practices can lead to higher yield of greenhouse tomato with improved market quality.},

The objectives of the work were to study the effect of three organic fertilizations on garlic production and to determine the macronutrient content in leaves during the crop cycle. The experiment was carried out in a completely randomized design with four replicates. The treatments were: T0, with inorganic fertilization (100 kg ha-1 of diamonic phosphate + 100 kg ha-1 of urea); T1, 16.07 kg ha-1 of bovine manure-Onion compost (+ 50 kg ha-1 of phosphate rock); T2, 2000 kg ha-1 of BioOrganutsa Nitro Plus a commercial organic fertilizer, (+ 50 kg ha-1 of phosphate rock); and T3, BioOrganutsa Nitro Plus + vermicompost tea (same as T2 + 1,25 L vermicompost tea). During both years, the number of leaves, height and dry weight along the cycle increased in all treatments. T2 and T3 showed the highest values compared to T1. Nitrogen and potassium content in leaves decreased gradually in all treatments after the beginning of bulb formation. At harvest, T2 and T3 presented the highest yield, weight and diameter bulbs in 2008, while T1 obtained the lowest values of these parameters. In 2007 T3 showed significant differences compared to T1 as regards the 3 parameters. The commercial organic fertilizer BioOrganutsa Nitro Plus + phosphate rock, incorporated alone or in combination with vermicompost tea, can be an alternative to fertilize organic garlic crop. It will be necessary to try different doses of the compost to evaluate its value as an organic fertilizer.},

   abstract = {The application of vermicompost as substrate amendment could benefit the vegetable transplants production and provide a sustainable nutrient management approach for the improvement of plant's growth. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of increasing amounts of cow-horse manure vermicompost on the growth and the nutrition of tomato transplants. Tomato transplants were grown in 0.5 L of peat moss and perlite mixture at 1:1 (v/v) ratio, in which the vermicompost constitutes 10 to 50% of the mixture's volume. Some growth characteristics as well as some physicochemical and chemical properties of the vermicompost-amended potting mixtures were investigated. The results indicated that utilization of 10 to 50% vermicompost stimulated the growth of tomato plants. The positive effect of the vermicompost on plant growth increased parallel with the increase of its content in the substrate volume. An increase of up to 3.7-fold was observed in shoot fresh weight, up to 2.6-fold increase in shoot length, up to 62% increase in leaf area, and up to 28% increase in number of leaves when vermicompost constituted 10-50% of the mixture volume, compared to the control (peat moss and perlite mixture without vermicompost). Moderate to strong correlations were established between N and K in potting mixtures and in plant tissues, suggesting that vermicompost contributes considerably to the supply of the plant with these nutrients. Consequently, the cow-horse manure vermicompost should be taken into consideration as a potential peat substitute in nurseries.},

   abstract = {A common problem often experienced by both small and large scale banana farmers is the reduction in quality and yield of bananas due to soil moisture deficits and declining soil fertility. To overcome this, mechanisms of improving yield without compromising environmental integrity or public health are being embraced. Globally, researchers have continued to evaluate the competence of environmental-friendly organic fertilizers and smoke solutions to improve the growth, yield and quality of various crops. In the present study, the effect of smoke-water (1:1,000; 1:500 and 1:250 dilutions) and vermicompost leachate (1:20; 1:10 and 1:5 dilutions) treatments on the growth of greenhouse grown bananas was evaluated. Soil drenching (smoke-water and vermicompost leachate) and foliar application (smoke-water) were tested on 1-month-old tissue-cultured banana seedlings under greenhouse conditions. After 3 months, growth parameters such as number and length of roots and shoots; number of leaves and leaf area as well as their fresh and dry weights were analyzed. Soil drenching with smoke-water significantly increased the root length (1:1,000 and 1:500 dilutions) as well as fresh and dry weight (1:1,000; 1:500 and 1:250 dilutions) when compared to foliar application. Vermicompost leachate (1:10 and 1:5 dilutions) significantly enhanced the shoot length, root length, leaf area and dry weights. Vermicompost leachate (1:20; 1:10 and 1:5 dilutions) also significantly increased the number of off-shoots. The positive effect on rooting is beneficial for acclimatization and establishment of tissue-cultured banana plantlets in nurseries and subsequent transfer to the field. Moreover, the high cost of inorganic fertilizers as well as environmental safety concerns makes the use of smoke-water and vermicompost leachate potential alternatives to improving the growth and cultivation of bananas.},

   abstract = {Over the past 16 years, vast plantings of transgenic crops producing insecticidal proteins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) have helped to control several major insect pests and reduce the need for insecticide sprays. Because broad-spectrum insecticides kill arthropod natural enemies that provide biological control of pests, the decrease in use of insecticide sprays associated with Bt crops could enhance biocontrol services. However, this hypothesis has not been tested in terms of long-term landscape-level impacts. On the basis of data from 1990 to 2010 at 36 sites in six provinces of northern China, we show here a marked increase in abundance of three types of generalist arthropod predators (ladybirds, lacewings and spiders) and a decreased abundance of aphid pests associated with widespread adoption of Bt cotton and reduced insecticide sprays in this crop. We also found evidence that the predators might provide additional biocontrol services spilling over from Bt cotton fields onto neighbouring crops (maize, peanut and soybean). Our work extends results from general studies evaluating ecological effects of Bt crops by demonstrating that such crops can promote biocontrol services in agricultural landscapes.},

   abstract = {The maintenance of biodiversity in agro-ecosystems is often viewed as an insurance against an uncertain future, yet, there is increasing evidence of biodiversity loss in agricultural landscapes. Here, we examined long term trends in the arable weed flora of North-East France by revisiting 158 arable fields initially surveyed in the 1970s. We assessed changes in species richness, density and frequency of occurrence in weed communities as well as for subgroups that are recognised for their conservation value. We also evaluated the importance of crop edges as potential refugia for the threatened arable weeds. Among the 121 species recorded in both surveys, 40% had significantly declined in frequency while 10% had significantly increased. At the field level, we recorded a 42% decline in species richness and a 67% decline in species density. Trends were comparable for weed species of particular conservation value. In the 2000s survey, crop edges harboured levels of weed diversity that were intermediate between those found in field cores in the 1970s and in the 2000s survey. Our results indicated that many species of conservation value had disappeared or seriously decreased in the field core but still persisted in the crop edge. The consequences of this general decline and possible conservation options are discussed in the light of the results. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

I argue that this transition has failed to advance the field toward its aim of preserving biodiversity. The abandonment of island biogeography theory in favor of complementarity-based algorithms is a case in point. In what follows, I consider the four central objections raised against island biogeographic conservation guidelines, arguing that they fail to undermine the credibility of this framework as a conservation tool. At best, these objections call for a more careful application of this framework to conservation problems, not its wholesale abandonment. At the same time, complementarily-based algorithms are biased in favor of networks of small reserves containing non-overlapping species. These conditions threaten to promote inbreeding depression, genetic drift and other factors that increase a popula- tion’s risk of extinction. Therefore, recent developments in the field of conservation biology have arguably not contributed to its ultimate aim of preserving the maximum amount of biodiversity in the long run.},

   abstract = {This review focuses on individual effects of major global change factors, such as elevated CO2, O3, UV light and temperature, on plant secondary chemistry. These secondary metabolites are well-known for their role in plant defense against insect herbivory. Global change effects on secondary chemicals appear to be plant species-specific and dependent on the chemical type. Even though plant chemical responses induced by these factors are highly variable, there seems to be some specificity in the response to different environmental stressors. For example, even though the production of phenolic compounds is enhanced by both elevated CO2 and UV light levels, the latter appears to primarily increase the concentrations of flavonoids. Likewise, specific phenolic metabolites seem to be induced by O3 but not by other factors, and an increase in volatile organic compounds has been particularly detected under elevated temperature. More information is needed regarding how global change factors influence inducibility of plant chemical defenses as well as how their indirect and direct effects impact insect performance and behavior, herbivory rates and pathogen attack. This knowledge is crucial to better understand how plants and their associated natural enemies will be affected in future changing environments.},

   abstract = {One of the oldest ecological hypotheses, proposed by Darwin, suggests that the struggle for existence is stronger between more closely related species. Despite its long history, the validity of this phylogenetic limiting similarity hypothesis has rarely been examined. Here we provided a formal experimental test of the hypothesis using pairs of bacterivorous protist species in a multigenerational experiment. Consistent with the hypothesis, both the frequency and tempo of competitive exclusion, and the reduction in the abundance of inferior competitors, increased with increasing phylogenetic relatedness of the competing species. These results were linked to protist mouth size, a trait potentially related to resource use, exhibiting a significant phylogenetic signal. The likelihood of coexistence, however, was better predicted by phylogenetic relatedness than trait similarity of the competing species. Our results support phylogenetic relatedness as a useful predictor of the outcomes of competitive interactions in ecological communities.},

   abstract = {The evolutionary response of plants to herbivory is constrained by the availability of resources in the environment. Woody plants adapted to low-resource environments have intrinsically slow growth rates that limit their capacity to grow rapidly beyond the reach of most browsing mammals. Their low capacity to acquire resources limits their potential for compensatory growth which would otherwise enable them to re- place tissue destroyed by browsing. Plants adapted to low-resource environments have responded to browsing by evolving strong constitutive defenses with relatively low ontogenetic plasticity. Because nutrients are often more limiting than light in boreal forests, slowly growing boreal forest trees utilize carbon-based rather than nitrogen-based defenses. More rapidly growing shade-intolerant trees that are adapted to growth in high-resource environments are selected for competitive ability and can grow rapidly beyond the range of most browsing mammals. Moreover, these plants have the carbon and nutrient reserves necessary to replace tissue lost to browsing through compensatory growth. However, because browsing of juvenile plants reduces vertical growth and thus competitive ability, these plants are selected for resistance to browsing during the juvenile growth phase. Consequently, early successional boreal forest trees have responded to browsing by evolving strong de- fenses during juvenility only. Because severe pruning causes woody plants to revert to a juvenile form, resistance of woody plants to hares increases after severe hare browsing as occurs during hare population outbreaks. This increase in browsing resistance may play a significant role in boreal forest plant-hare interactions. Unlike woody plants, graminoids retain large reserves of carbon and nutrients below ground in both low-resource and high-resource environments and can respond to severe grazing through compensatory growth. These fundamental differences between the response of woody plants and graminoids to vertebrate herbivory suggest that the dynamics of browsing systems and grazing systems are qualitatively different.

Other factors, such as overabundant deer, may hinder temperate expansion. We examined how interactions among temperature, browse pressure, light availability, and initial size impact height and radial growth of naturally regenerated, competing temperate and boreal saplings across their overlapping range limits in central North America. In 9 of 10 growth model comparisons, the inclusion of mean summer temperature and browse damage as explanatory variables strongly improved model performance over the base model with only initial size and light availability as parameters. Potential growth reductions due to browse damage and temperature limitation were similar in magnitude (up to ~50%). Temperate sapling growth increased and boreal growth decreased with temperature across a regional summer temperature gradient (2.3 °C), causing a rank reversal in growth rates, and suggesting that temperature is a key driver of sapling performance and range boundaries. However, under high browse pressure positive temperate responses to temperature were eliminated, essentially pushing the crossover point in growth between temperate and boreal species further south. These results highlight the importance of interactions among global change agents and potential impediments for tree species to track a rapidly changing climate. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {If controls over primary productivity and plant community composition are mainly environmental, as opposed to biological, then global change may result in large-scale alterations in ecosystem structure and function. This view appears to be favored among investigations of plant biomass and community responses to experimental and observed warming. In far northern and arctic ecosystems, such studies predict increasing dominance of woody shrubs with future warming and emphasize the carbon (C)-sequestration potential and consequent atmospheric feedback potential of such responses. In contrast to previous studies, we incorporated natural herbivory by muskoxen and caribou into a 5-year experimental investigation of arctic plant community response to warming. In accordance with other studies, warming increased total community biomass by promoting growth of deciduous shrubs (dwarf birch and gray willow). However, muskoxen and caribou reduced total community biomass response, and responses of birch and willow, to warming by 19%, 46%, and 11%, respectively. Furthermore, under warming alone, the plant community shifted after 5 years away from graminoid-dominated toward dwarf birch-dominated. In contrast, where herbivores grazed, plant community composition on warmed plots did not differ from that on ambient plots after 5 years. These results highlight the potentially important and overlooked influences of vertebrate herbivores on plant community response to warming and emphasize that conservation and management of large herbivores may be an important component of mitigating ecosystem response to climate change.},

Condensed tannins (proanthocyanidins), in-vitro digestibility, initial rates of gas evolution (as an indicator of the initial rates of fermentation of the substrate), volatile fatty acid evolution, and non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) levels were determined in leaves, stems and roots at full flowering. Under control conditions (average midsummer conditions in the United Kingdom) the total condensed tannin content of leaves varied six-fold between genotypes but condensed tannin contents in stems and roots were similar. Condensed tannin levels were significantly increased in leaves and stems of all three genotypes by doubling the CO2 concentration while raising the temperature towards the optimum for growth significantly reduced condensed tannin levels. Drought stress significantly reduced condensed tannin levels in leaves and, particularly, in roots. Nutritive value was inversely related to condensed tannin levels in leaves and a negative relationship was observed between condensed tannin concentrations of more than 25–30 g kg−1 dry matter and the initial rates of gas evolution when subjected to in-vitro fermentation with rumen micro-organisms. In leaves, digestibility was significantly increased by drought and by increasing temperature but reduced by high CO2. In stems, digestibility was significantly increased by drought, but not significantly affected by increasing temperature, or by high CO2 alone. In roots, digestibility was significantly increased by drought, and decreased by increasing temperature or CO2. Increasing the growth temperature towards optimum growth reduced the content of NSC in all tissues with the greatest changes occurring in root tissue. Doubling the CO2 concentration increased NSC levels in leaves and stems with starch content more than doubled under high CO2 while, in roots, increased levels were only observed in combination with drought stress. There was a linear correlation between condensed tannin concentration and total NSC that was positive for leaves, neutral for stems and negative for roots. The relationship between carbohydrate levels and rates of gas production was negative for leaves and positive for stem and roots.},

We tested this hypothesis on four evergreen woody species growing in a Mediterranean area with a high density of ungulates. In this system, levels of browsing are more intense in the winter (due to the lack of annual plants) and young foliage is often preferred. Therefore we predicted that the chemical defences of these species, namely their phenolic content, would vary with leaf age, season and damage intensity. In addition, we tested whether ungulates preferentially selected species containing lower phenolic levels, and also whether browsing induced either chemical or morphological changes in damaged plants. Phenolic levels varied greatly between plant species; ungulates browsed preferentially on the species with the lowest phenolic levels. No difference in phenolic content was found between browsed and unbrowsed trees. Morphological changes in heavily browsed trees included an increase in shoot and leaf density and a net decrease in leaf size. We suggest that for Mediterranean plants, which have evolved under high browsing pressure from large mammals, the production of small leaves and dense shoots in response to browsing might decrease ungulate foraging efficiency and hence reduce the rate of further damage as effectively as high levels of chemical defence.},

Attempts to reduce ungulate browsing, have often been unsuccessful, controversial or too costly. The aim or the work described here was to improve our understanding of the factors that lead to browsing on silver fir. The silver fir content in the diet of three sympatric ungulate species, chamois Rupicapra rupicapra, red deer Cervus elaphus and roe deer Capreolus capreolus, was determined by microhistological analysis of faeces collected at four sites in the Alps. Further, the supply of silver fir was assessed at the individual tree and patch scale and then extrapolated to site scale. Silver fir consumption was highest in winter, when diet composition varied among sites but not among ungulate species. Towards the summer, site-differences decreased and differences among ungulate species increased. Red and roe deer reduced consumption of silver fir, whereas chamois kept it constant. The use of silver fir was unrelated to the supply at the various sites, but increased with the proportion of trees growing amidst palatable herbaceous species. At the individual plant scale, ungulates browsed on the saplings with the larger needles. These results indicate that silver fir as food does not rank high among the available plant species, but is eaten opportunistically, especially when it grows close to more preferred food plants. However, when alternative food is scarce, particularly in winter, it may also represent a shortage food supply, and larger quantities are consumed. Yet, the fact that feeding on silver fir is mostly opportunistic may offer forest managers a way to approach the 'browsing problem'.},

We used the ground observations from 103 temperate forests (10 species and 3,708 trees) from the French Renecofor Network and for the period 1997-2006. We applied RandomForest algorithms to predict phenological events from climatic and ecological variables. With the resulting models, we drew maps of phenological events throughout France under present climate and under two climatic change scenarios (A2, B2) and four global circulation models (HadCM3, CGCM2, CSIRO2 and PCM). We compared current observations and predicted values for the periods 2041-2070 and 2071-2100. On average, spring development of oaks precedes that of beech, which precedes that of conifers. Annual cycles in budburst and leaf coloring are highly correlated with January, March-April and October-November weather conditions through temperature, global solar radiation or potential evapotranspiration depending on species. At the end of the twenty-first century, each model predicts earlier budburst (mean: 7 days) and later leaf coloring (mean: 13 days) leading to an average increase in the growing season of about 20 days (for oaks and beech stands). The A2-HadCM3 hypothesis leads to an increase of up to 30 days in many areas. As a consequence of higher predicted warming during autumn than during winter or spring, shifts in leaf coloring dates appear greater than trends in leaf unfolding. At a regional scale, highly differing climatic response patterns were observed.},

Parameters of particular importance include: (1) the vulnerability of stems to drought-induced cavitation events because cavitation reduces the hydraulic conductance of stems, (2) the leaf specific conductivity of stems because it determines the pressure gradients and most negative water potentials needed to sustain evaporation from leaves, (3) the water storage capacity of tissues because this might determine the ability of trees to survive long drought periods. All of these parameters are determined by the structure and function of anatomical components of trees. Some of the ecological and physiological trade-offs of specific structures are discussed.},

   abstract = {We used sap flow as a measure of whole-tree function to examine how coniferous and broad-leaved species in mixed temperate forests differ in canopy-level transpiration and photosynthetic rates. We used heat dissipation probes to measure whole-tree sap flow in three species throughout one full year and then combined these measurements with micrometeorological monitoring and leaf-level gas exchange to determine whole-tree carbon gain. Both broad-leaved species (red oak, Quercus rubra L.; red maple, Acer rubrum L.) had two- to four-fold greater annual fluxes of water and carbon on a ground area basis than did the conifer (eastern hemlock, Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carriere), with red oak trees additionally showing 60-80% higher fluxes than red maple. Despite fixing one-third of its carbon when broad-leaved species were leafless, hemlock was not able to compensate for its low photosynthetic rates during the growing season. Productivity measures derived from annual growth rings and eddy covariance confirmed that whole-tree sap flow provided a valuable estimate of both the magnitude of current forest fluxes and differences in individual species' fluxes. Our results indicate that the predicted loss of hemlock from mixed temperate forests could potentially increase whole-forest water loss and carbon gain by two- to four-fold, provided sufficient nitrogen and water remain available to support such a change.},

   abstract = {The relationship between photosynthetic capacity (A(max)) and leaf nitrogen concentration (N) among all C-3 species can be described roughly with one general equation, yet within that overall pattern species groups or individual species may have markedly different A(max)-N relationships. To determine whether one or several predictive, fundamental A(max)-N relationships exist for temperate trees we measured A(max) specific leaf area (SLA) and N in 22 broad-leaved deciduous and 9 needle-leaved evergreen tree species in Wisconsin, United States. For broad-leaved deciduous trees, mass-based A(max) was highly correlated with leaf N (r(2)=0.75, P<0.001). For evergreen conifers, mass-based A(max) was also correlated with leaf N (r(2)=0.59, P<0.001) and the slope of the regression (rate of increase of A(max) per unit increase in N) was lower (P<0.001) by two-thirds than in the broad-leaved species (1.9 vs. 6.4 mu mol CO2 g(-1) N s(-1)), consistent with predictions based on tropical rain forest trees of short vs. long leaf Life-span. On an area basis, there was a strong A(max)-N correlation among de ciduous species (r(2)=0.78, P<0.001) and no correlation (r(2)=0.03, P>0.25) in the evergreen conifers. Compared to deciduous trees at a common leaf N (mass or area basis), evergreen trees had lower A(max) and SLA. For all data pooled, both leaf N and A(max) on a mass basis were correlated (r(2)=0.6) with SLA; in contrast, area-based leaf N scaled tightly with SLA (r(2)=0.81), but area-based A(max) did not (r(2)=0.06) because of low A(max) per unit N in the evergreen conifers. Multiple regression analysis of all data pooled showed that both N (mass or area basis) and SLA were significantly (P<0.001) related to A(max) on mass (r(2)=0.80) and area (r(2)=0.55) bases, respectively. These results provide further evidence that A(max)-N relationships are fundamentally different for ecologically distinct species groups with differing suites of foliage characteristics: species with long leaf life-spans and low SLA, whether broad-leaved or needle-leaved, tend to have lower A(max) per unit leaf N and a lower slope and higher intercept of the A(max)-N relation than do species with shorter leaf life-span and higher SLA. A single global A(max)-N equation overestimates and underestimates A(max) for temperate trees at the upper and lower end of their leaf N range, respectively. Users of A(max)-N relationships in modeling photosynthesis in different ecosystems should appreciate the strengths and limitations of regression equations based on different species groupings.},

Biodiversity is suggested to positively influence multiple services but evidence from natural systems at scales relevant to management is scarce. Here, across a scale of 400,000 km(2), we report that tree species richness in production forests shows positive to positively hump-shaped relationships with multiple ecosystem services. These include production of tree biomass, soil carbon storage, berry production and game production potential. For example, biomass production was approximately 50% greater with five than with one tree species. In addition, we show positive relationships between tree species richness and proxies for other biodiversity components. Importantly, no single tree species was able to promote all services, and some services were negatively correlated to each other. Management of production forests will therefore benefit from considering multiple tree species to sustain the full range of benefits that the society obtains from forests.},

If so, double-blind reviewing might be an alternative approach that avoids such bias. We investigated the effects of gender, nationality (English-speaking countries only), academic age, year of review, and handling editor on the decisions made on a sample of 1856 papers submitted to the journal Biological Conservation between 2004 and 2007. There is no evidence of differences in acceptance rates among genders, nationalities, academic age, or year, nor is there evidence for interactions among these factors. Individual handling editors differed in the proportions of papers that they accepted, rejected following review, and rejected without review, but did not show biases based on any of the factors we examined. Overall, we did not find evidence supporting a change in the present review system, although the low rate of acceptance of papers from certain non-English-speaking countries is an issue that needs to be addressed. We believe that these types of audits of the editorial system are necessary, so that all submitting authors feel that the editorial process is fair, unbiased and rigorous. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Plants are attacked by many different consumers. A critical question is how often, and under what conditions, common reductions in growth, fecundity or even survival that occur due to herbivory translate to meaningful impacts on abundance, distribution or dynamics of plant populations. Here, we review population-level studies of the effects of consumers on plant dynamics and evaluate: (i) whether particular consumers have predictably more or less influence on plant abundance, (ii) whether particular plant life-history types are predictably more vulnerable to herbivory at the population level, (iii) whether the strength of plant-consumer interactions shifts predictably across environmental gradients and (iv) the role of consumers in influencing plant distributional limits. Existing studies demonstrate numerous examples of consumers limiting local plant abundance and distribution. We found larger effects of consumers on grassland than woodland forbs, stronger effects of herbivory in areas with high versus low disturbance, but no systematic or unambiguous differences in the impact of consumers based on plant life-history or herbivore feeding mode. However, our ability to evaluate these and other patterns is limited by the small (but growing) number of studies in this area. As an impetus for further study, we review strengths and challenges of population-level studies, such as interpreting net impacts of consumers in the presence of density dependence and seed bank dynamics.},

Focus on the detoxification pathways employed by specialist and generalist herbivores has facilitated explicit tests of the long-standing hypothesis that detoxification rates limit feeding.

Thus, ecologists have largely focused on the role of competition for limited re- sources but have ignored herbivory as a primary factor determining plant success. Here, we present a quantitative review of herbivore manipulations and find that herbivores do exert important effects on plant biomass—equally as important as those of plant competition. This result should alter the way plant communities are investigated. Further- more, we find that the effects of invertebrate herbivores are significantly stronger than those of vertebrates; this is in contrast to widely held views. Quantitative syntheses of accumulated studies, such as the one presented here, can provide surprising answers to a broad scope of biological questions. This is especially important in fields lacking a strong theoretical basis, in which generalities are born from empiricism rather than deductive theorizing. KEY},

@article{Provenza2003,
   abstract = {We contend diets and habitats that allow animals to select among alternatives enable individuals to better meet needs for nutrients and to better cope with toxins. All plants contain toxins, and the amount of toxin an animal can ingest depends on the kinds and amounts of nutrients and toxins in the forages on offer. Nutrients and toxins both cause animals to satiate, and excesses of nutrients, nutrient imbalances, and toxins all limit food intake. Thus, individuals can better meet their needs for nutrients and regulate their intake of toxins when offered a variety of foods that differ in nutrients and toxins than when constrained to a single food, even if the food is "nutritionally balanced". Food intake and preference also depend on differences in how individual animals are built morphologically and how they function physiologically, and marked variation is common even among closely related animals in needs for nutrients and abilities to cope with toxins. Transient food aversions compound the inefficiency of single-food diets - whether in confinement, on pastures, or on rangelands - by depressing intake among individual animals, even if they are suited "on average" to that nutrient or toxin profile. Thus, feeding and grazing practices that allow producers to capitalize on the individuality of animals are likely to improve performance of the herd by enabling the uniqueness of individuals to become manifest. Finally, past experiences play a crucial role in an animal's propensity to learn to eat different foods. When herbivores are allowed to eat only the most preferred plants, they are not likely to learn to mix foods high in nutrients with foods that contain toxins. Conversely, herbivores encouraged to eat all plants in an area are more likely to learn to eat mixes of plants that mitigate toxicity. Experienced animals who have learned to eat a variety of foods that differ in nutrients and toxins do so even when nutritious alternatives are available, whereas naive animals familiar only with the nutritious alternatives eat only that subset of familiar foods. Different systems of management alter how animals forage. Continuous grazing at low stock densities encourages selectivity and reduces diet and habitat breadth, whereas short-duration grazing at high stock densities increases diet and habitat breadth. Thus, what was traditionally considered proper grazing management - rotational grazing at low stock densities - may have trained generations of livestock to "eat the best and leave the rest" thus inadvertently accelerating a decline in biodiversity and an increase in the abundance of less desirable plant species. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

   abstract = {Research on plant tolerance to herbivory has been so far largely focussed on herbaceous plants partly due to the implicit assumption that woody plants are inherently lower in their compensatory potential as compared to herbs. However, tolerance to herbivory should be an important part of resistance of woody plants because their apparency to herbivory is high due to a large size and long life span, and their defence systems cannot completely exclude herbivory. Moreover, the longer life span, more complex modularity and higher sectorality of woody plants as compared to herbs imply that compensatory responses in woody plants may take several years to develop, and that consequences of herbivore damage to individual modules may profoundly differ from whole-plant responses. Therefore, short-term studies using branches or ramets as experimental units are likely to underestimate the tolerance of woody plants to herbivory. In addition, defoliation by insects (the most common type of herbivory experienced by woody plants) is less likely to release apical dominance and trigger biomass compensation than mammalian grazing on herbaceous plants. We conclude, therefore, that the seemingly different recovery potentials exhibited by woody and herbaceous plants are more likely to be the consequences of differences between the two types of plants in modular architecture, longevity and the type of herbivory they commonly experience rather than indications of inherent differences in compensatory ability.},

   abstract = {Introduced mammalian herbivores can significantly affect ecosystems. Here, I review evidence on effects of introduced mammalian herbivores in the temperate forest of the southern Andes. Available data suggest that introduced herbivores decrease the abundance of seedlings and saplings of dominant tree species in some forest types, which could impair forest regeneration. They also affect understory species composition. The mechanisms of the effects of introduced herbivores are complex, and include direct effects of browsing or trampling and more complex interactions such as indirect effects through other species. Some native mammalian and avian predators may benefit from increased food availability resulting from high densities of some introduced mammalian herbivores. In turn, enhanced populations of predators may have resulted in increased predation on native prey. Competition for resources and disease transmission have also been proposed as possible negative effects of introduced herbivores on native herbivores, but little evidence supports this claim. Little is known about effects on invertebrates.},

   abstract = {As the world's climate warms, the phenologies of interacting organisms in seasonally cold environments may advance at differing rates, leading to alterations in phenological synchrony that can have important ecological consequences. For temperate and boreal species, the timing of early spring development plays a key role in plant-herbivore interactions and can influence insect performance, outbreak dynamics, and plant damage. We used a field-based, meso-scale free-air forest warming experiment (B4WarmED) to examine the effects of elevated temperature on the phenology and performance of forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria) in relation to the phenology of two host trees, aspen (Populus tremuloides) and birch (Betula papyrifera). Results of our 2-year study demonstrated that spring phenology advanced for both insects and trees, with experimentally manipulated increases in temperature of 1.7 and 3.4 °C. However, tree phenology advanced more than insect phenology, resulting in altered phenological synchrony. Specifically, we observed a decrease in the time interval between herbivore egg hatch and budbreak of aspen in both years and birch in one year. Moreover, warming decreased larval development time from egg hatch to pupation, but did not affect pupal mass. Larvae developed more quickly on aspen than birch, but pupal mass was not affected by host species. Our study reveals that warming-induced phenological shifts can alter the timing of ecological interactions across trophic levels. These findings illustrate one mechanism by which climate warming could mediate insect herbivore outbreaks, and also highlights the importance of climate change effects on trophic interactions.},

   abstract = {Both theoretical arguments and empirical evidence suggests that herbivory in general and mammalian winter herbivory in particular is important in arctic-alpine ecosystems. Although knowledge of the effect of herbivores on specific plants and communities is quite extensive, little is known about the relative impact of large and small vertebrate herbivores and how it might vary among different habitats. To address this key issue, we established exclosures with two different mesh sizes in forest and nearby tundra at three different sites in four contrasting locations in the forest-tundra ecotone in northernmost Sweden and Norway. Plant community composition was recorded annually in three permanent plots within each exclosure and an unfenced control. Local densities of vertebrate herbivores were estimated in spring and autumn from 1998 to 2002. Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) were the most abundant large vertebrate while Norwegian lemmings (Lemmus lemmus) and grey-sided voles (Clethrionomys rufocanus) were the most common small vertebrates. The study reveals that voles and lemmings have larger effects on the vegetation than reindeer in both habitats in all four locations, even though densities of reindeer differ between locations and only two locations experienced lemming peaks during the period of the experiment. The relative abundance of five of the fifteen most common species was significantly influenced by voles and lemmings whereas only a single species was significantly influenced by reindeer. Different analyses give contrasting results on the importance of herbivory in forest versus open heathlands. A principal component analyses revealed that herbivory influenced the vegetation more in open heathlands than in forests. However, an importance index of herbivores did not differ between forest and open heathlands. Moreover, none of the plant species responded differently in the two habitats, when herbivores were removed. Our results suggest that intense and localised selective foraging by small mammals may have a more marked effect on vegetation than transient feeding by reindeerwas not downloaded},

   abstract = {The nature of "climate change" will differ with geographical regions and its final impact on ecosystems vary with the extent of temperature increase, changes in irradiance and levels of UVB, amount and patterns of precipitation and humidity, and alterations in the incidence and nature of abiotic disturbances. Despite many uncertainties, there is consensus in the fact that global warming already has and will have impact on the temporal and spatial dynamics of insect herbivores. Ectothermic organisms are affected by the changes in environmental conditions directly in dispersal, reproduction, development and mortality, and indirectly through altered plant nutritional quality, resistance and via community interactions. Ambiguous consequences are to be expected depending on the individual host plant and herbivore species, probably involving altered incidence and intensity of pest outbreaks and changes in distributional ranges. Regions that represent northern or upper limits of occurrence, such as the Alps or the boreal zone, are likely to be affected most by an increase in stability and population density of certain pest species, such as defoliating insects or bark beetles. At the same time, temperature increase and drought will render areas of distribution in southern and continental parts of Europe less suitable for heat susceptible species, which will probably not only result in northwards shifts, but range contractions. The review is based on chapters of the "Study on impacts of climate change on European forests and options for adaptation" led by the European Forest Institute (Efi) and on results of the EU project "PROMOTH - Global change and pine processionary moth: a new challenge for integrated pest management". Thaumetopoea pityocampa serves as illustrative example for insect herbivores whose latitudinal and altitudinal distribution is mainly controlled by temperature and already modified by global warming. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Our aim was to test the hypothesis that plant functional traits and/or ecological strategies are good predictors of the background losses of woody plant foliage to insects (i.e. losses occurring when herbivore populations are at their ‘normal’ densities) at the global scale.\n\n\n* We conducted a quantitative synthesis of published and original data on foliar losses of 793 species of woody plants belonging to 128 families from ca. 500 localities world-wide, representing tropical, temperate and polar climate zones.\n\n\n* The background foliar losses to insects varied among plant life forms, increasing from dwarf shrubs to large trees, and were higher in inherently fast-growing species than in slow-growing species. These patterns supported predictions of both the apparency and growth rate (resource availability) hypotheses for data combined across localities, but only outside the tropics.\n\n\n* Foliar losses to insects slightly but significantly increased with specific leaf area (SLA) in all climate zones.\n\n\n* No differences were noted in background herbivory between woody plant species with deciduous and evergreen foliage, with different shade tolerance and with different successional status.\n\n\n* Synthesis. Factors affecting the distribution of herbivory among species of woody plants differed among the climate zones, and the predictive power of at least some of the theories/hypotheses addressing plant–herbivore interactions at large spatial scales varies among climates and/or biomes. The average background losses of woody plant foliage to insects across localities can be predicted from the inherent growth rate of the plant species, its life form and SLA, although these plant characteristics jointly explain only a minor part of the total variation observed in the primary data.\n\n},

   abstract = {Aim Latitudinal patterns in biotic interactions, particularly in herbivory, have been widely debated. We conducted a quantitative research synthesis to test whether background losses of woody plant foliage to insects generally decrease from the equator to the poles, and whether geographical gradients in insect herbivory are stronger at higher latitudes than at lower latitudes. Location Global terrestrial ecosystems. Methods We used published and original data (3482 point estimates of the percentage of leaf area consumed by insects, collected from 941 species of woody plants in 836 localities world-wide) to analyse the geographical patterns in total losses of plant foliage and in losses to defoliating, leaf mining and leaf galling insects separately, and we searched for climatic factors that can explain the variation in the levels of background insect herbivory across the globe and within climate zones. Result On average, according to published data woody plants lose 7.55% of their leaf area to insects, but 4.73% according to our original data collected in a blinded way. These losses demonstrate a dome-shaped latitudinal pattern: they peak in temperate zones, slightly decrease towards the equator and strongly decrease towards the poles. This pattern is consistent between published and original data, indicating the robustness of the detected relationship between herbivory and latitude. The climatic factors explaining these latitudinal patterns in insect herbivory differ between climate zones. Main conclusions Our study provides solid support for the hypothesis of a decrease in background herbivory with latitude, but only outside the tropics. For the first time we demonstrate that the latitudinal gradient in insect herbivory across the globe is nonlinear, i.e. its slope differs between the climate zones. In temperate and polar zones, but not in the tropics, background herbivory correlates with mean air temperatures and is therefore likely to increase with climate warming.},

Mature coniferous stands also ranked low in relative abundance of shrews and had the lowest abundance of deer mice relative to other mature stand types. Mature deciduous stands ranked high in abundance of deer mice and had the greatest abundance of short-tailed shrews among all stand types. Despite reduced canopy closure, lower relative density of coniferous trees and saplings, and decreased basal area of deciduous trees and snags, partially harvested stands supported densities of mice and voles comparable to mature mixed-forest types.

   abstract = {Herbivores and pathogens impact the species composition, ecosystem function, and socioeconomic value of forests. Herbivores and pathogens are an integral part of forests, but sometimes produce undesirable effects and a degradation of forest resources. In the United States, a few species of forest pests routinely have significant impacts on up to 20 million ha of forest with economic costs that probably exceed $1 billion / year. Climatic change could alter patterns of disturbance from herbivores and pathogens through: (1) direct effects on the development and survival of herbivores and pathogens; (2) physiological changes in tree defenses; and (3) indirect effects from changes in the abundance of natural enemies (e.g. parasitoids of insect herbivores), mutualists (e.g. insect vectors of tree pathogens), and competitors. Because of their short life cycles, mobility, reproductive potential, and physiological sensitivity to temperature, even modest climate change will have rapid impacts on the distribution and abundance of many forest insects and pathogens. We identify 32 syndromes of biotic disturbance in North American forests that should be carefully evaluated for their responses to climate change: 15 insect herbivores, browsing mammals; 12 pathogens; 1 plant parasite; and 3 undiagnosed patterns of forest decline. It is probable that climatic effects on some herbivores and pathogens will impact on biodiversity, recreation, property value, forest industry, and even water quality. Some scenarios are beneficial (e.g. decreased snow cover may increase winter mortality of some insect pests), but many are detrimental (e.g. warming tends to accelerate insect development rate and facilitate range expansions of pests and climate change tends to produce a mismatch between mature trees and their environment, which can increase vulnerability to herbivores and pathogens). Changes in forest disturbance can produce feedback to climate through affects on water and carbon flux in forest ecosystems; one alarming scenario is that climate warming may increase insect outbreaks in boreal forests, which would tend to increase forest fires and exacerbate further climate warming by releasing carbon stores from boreal ecosystems. We suggest a list of research priorities that will allow us to refine these risk assessments and adopt forest management strategies that anticipate changes in biotic disturbance regimes and mitigate the ecological, social, and economic risks.},

   abstract = {Large mammalian herbivores not only depend on plant communities for their existence but cause major changes in plant community composition and structure. These changes have direct consequences for ecosystem processes, but recent studies of ungulate-ecosystem relations show widely divergent ungulate effects in different ecosystems. We reviewed studies of ungulate effects on plant community composition to gain insight into potential mechanisms of ungulate-induced changes in both community composition and ecosystem processes. Our analysis of these studies is based on the premise that the effect ungulates exert on plant communities depends on the balance between (1) feeding selectivity of herbivores (i.e., degree to which dif- ferent plant species or ecotypes experience different levels of tissue loss), and (2) differences among plant species in their ability to recover from tissue loss. A large number of studies clearly show that selective ungulate herbivory leads to the dominance of unpalatable, chemically defended plant species in communities. However, many studies have also demonstrated that intensive long-term herbivory does not lead to the invasion of unpalatable species into the community, and can even increase the dominance of highly palatable species. Our review indicates that high levels of nutrient inputs or recycling and an intermittent temporal pattern of her- bivory (often due to migration) are key factors increasing the regrowth capacity of palatable species and hence maintaining their dominance in plant communities supporting abundant herbivores. Key factors limiting un- gulate foraging selectivity, again limiting herbivore-induced dominance of slow-growing, unpalatable species, include herding behavior, early growing season and postfire herbivory, asynchronous phenology of palatable versus unpalatable species, and low relative abundance of unpalatable species. Our review indicates differences among ecosystems in the role played by ungulate herbivory result from the relative strength of these factors enhancing plant tolerance to herbivory and limiting foraging selectivity. Anthropogenic changes in these factors (e.g., alteration of migration patterns) therefore have the potential to significantly alter the effects of ungulates on plant communities and ecosystem processes.},

Significant changes in the structure and composition of seemingly undisturbed Wisconsin forest communities have occurred over the past 50 years, including widespread declines in alpha and beta species diversity. To investigate how shifts in species composition have affected distributions of plant functional traits, we first compiled extensive data on understory plant species traits. We then computed community-weighted trait means and functional diversity metrics for communities in both the 1950s and 2000s. We examined how trait values and diversity varied across environmental gradients and among Wisconsin's four main ecoregions. Trait means and diversity values reflect conspicuous gradients in species composition, soils, and climatic conditions. Over the past 50 years, values of most traits have changed as communities shifted toward species with higher leaf nutrient levels and specific leaf area, particularly in the southern ecoregions. Trait richness and diversity have declined, particularly in historically species- and trait-rich unglaciated southwestern Wisconsin. Reductions in within-site trait diversity may be diminishing the ability of these forest communities to resist or resiliently respond to shifts in environmental conditions. Despite changes in trait and community composition, trait environment relationships measured directly via fourth-corner analysis remain strong for most plant traits. Nevertheless, accelerating ecological change (including climate change) could outstrip the ability of plant species and traits to match their environment, particularly in more fragmented landscapes.},

   abstract = {Eleven out of 13 disruption profiles (plots of dispenser density vs. male catch) from moth sex pheromone literature were consistent with a competitive-attraction mechanism, in which dispensers attract males and thereby divert them from females. Mean dispenser activity (D(a)) across all competitive-attraction cases was 0.04 +/- 0.06 (SD); values ranged from 0.0005 for a tiny laminated flake dispenser of racemic disparlure targeting gypsy moth to 0.2 for polyethylene tube dispensers used against lightbrown apple moth. A dispenser application activity (D(Aa)) can be calculated by multiplying D(a) by the number of such dispensers applied per hectare of crop. The highest dispenser application activity (D(Aa)) values approached 200 and corresponded to >99% inhibition of catches of male moths in monitoring traps. Relative to the D(Aa) scale, % inhibition of catches of male moths compressed and obscured large differences in D(Aa) when % disruption exceeded 90%. For cases of competitive attraction, these two efficacy scales can be interconverted by using the formula: D(Aa) approximately = 100/(100 minus % disruption). When disruptive point sources of pheromone were directly observed, male moths were seen approaching pheromone dispensers whose disruption profiles matched competitive attraction. Two cases fit non-competitive disruption mechanisms, which include camouflage, desensitization (adaptation and/or habituation), and sensory imbalance. In these cases, pheromone was released at rates higher than for cases of disruption by competitive attraction. Practical ramifications of the finding that competitive attraction appears to be the prevalent mechanism for moth mating disruption by pheromone point sources are listed. We believe that the congruence of diverse sets of mating disruption field data with explicit a priori predictions validates competitive-attraction theory. The analytical tools and principles governing competitive attraction that were uncovered during this study of mating disruption of moths should be generally applicable to competitive-attraction phenomena.},

How synthetic disruptant interrupts normal orientation is uncertain, but the most probable mechanisms invoke adaptation and habituation, competition between point sources of formulation and fe­ males, and a camouflage of a female's pheromone plume by the formulation.

   abstract = {It is one thing to show that herbivorous insects affect plant performance. It is an entirely different matter to demonstrate that insect herbivory affects plant population dynamics. There is a vast literature on insect pests of crop plants that shows how attack by defoliating, sucking, stem-mining, and gall-forming species can delay seed ripening, reduce seed production and individual seed weights, reduce the rates of shoot and root growth, increase the susceptibility of plants to disease, and reduce the competitive ability of plants relative to their un attacked neighbors. This literature tells us virtually nothing, however, about the importance of insects in natural communities, chiefly because we have so little information on the regulation of plant populations in the wild. For example, we do not know whether plant recruitment is seed limited, so we cannot predict whether there would be an increase in plant numbers if the simple experiment of sowing extra seeds were carried out. Information on the nature of population regulation is vital because if plant recruitment is not seed limited, then insects that reduce seed production will not have an important effect on plant population dynamics. This review concentrates on material published from 1984 to 1987. Earlier material has been covered in other reviews (36, 64, 70, 94, 107, 121, 182, 206). The first part examines the impact of insect feeding on different aspects of plant performance. The second part examines two of the best sources of evidence on the impact of insect feeding on plant population dynamics: (a) the release of specialist insect herbivores against target weed species in classicalbiological control projects and (b) the exclusion of insect herbivores from natural plant communities by the repeated application of chemical in­ secticides. The limitations and shortcomings of these bodies of evidence are also discussed.},

   abstract = {This study compiles and summarizes the existing knowledge about observed and projected impacts of climate change on forests in Europe. Forests will have to adapt not only to changes in mean climate variables but also to increased variability with greater risk of extreme weather events, such as prolonged drought, storms and floods. Sensitivity, potential impacts, adaptive capacity, and vulnerability to climate change are reviewed for European forests. The most important potential impacts of climate change on forest goods and services are summarized for the Boreal, Temperate Oceanic, Temperate Continental, Mediterranean, and mountainous regions. Especially in northern and western Europe the increasing atmospheric CO2 content and warmer temperatures are expected to result in positive effects on forest growth and wood production, at least in the short-medium term. On the other hand, increasing drought and disturbance risks will cause adverse effects. These negative impacts are very likely to outweigh positive trends in southern and eastern Europe. From west to east, the drought risk increases. In the Mediterranean regions productivity is expected to decline due to strongly increased droughts and fire risks. Adaptive capacity consists of the inherent adaptive capacity of trees and forest ecosystems and of socio-economic factors determining the capability to implement planned adaptation. The adaptive capacity in the forest sector is relatively large in the Boreal and the Temperate Oceanic regions, more constrained by socio-economic factors in the Temperate Continental, and most limited in the Mediterranean region where large forest areas are only extensively managed or unmanaged. Potential impacts and risks are best studied and understood with respect to wood production. It is clear that all other goods and services provided by European forests will also be impacted by climate change, but much less knowledge is available to quantify these impacts. Understanding of adaptive capacity and regional vulnerability to climate change in European forests is not well developed and requires more focussed research efforts. An interdisciplinary research agenda integrated with monitoring networks and projection models is needed to provide information at all levels of decision making, from policy development to the management unit. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Multiple consumers often attack seeds, seedlings, and adult plants, but their population-level consequences remain uncertain. We examined how insect and small mammal consumers influenced the demography and abundance of the perennial shrub, bush lupine (Lupinus arboreus). In grassland and dune habitats we established replicate experimental lupine populations in 81-m2 plots that were either protected from, or exposed to, herbivorous voles and granivorous mice (via fencing) and/or root feeding insects (via insecticide treatment). Populations were initiated with transplanted seedlings in 1999 and 2000. We followed the demography of these cohorts, subsequent generations, and the seed bank for 5.5 years. Voles and insects killed many seedlings in dune (1999 only) and grassland (1999 and 2000) habitats. After 2000, insects and voles had minimal effects on seedling or adult survival. Seed predation by granivorous mice, however, greatly depressed seedling recruitment, resulting in lower adult lupine abundance in control plots vs. those protected from rodents. In grasslands, initial effects of voles and insects on seedling survival produced large differences among treatments in adult plant density and the cumulative number of seeds produced throughout the experiment. Differences among grassland populations in seed rain, however, had little influence on the magnitude of seedling recruitment into this habitat. Instead, recruitment out of a preexisting seed bank compensated for the lack of seed production in populations exposed to consumers. Shading by dense adults in plots protected from consumers limited seedling establishment within these populations. Although differences among populations in cumulative seed rain did not influence adult establishment, populations protected from consumers accumulated substantially larger seed banks than controls. These results illustrate how density dependence, habitat-specific seed dynamics, and particular demographic impacts of consumers interact to shape plant population responses to consumers.},

   abstract = {1 Exclosure techniques were used to assess the relative roles of arthropods, molluscs and rodent herbivores in the mortality of herbaceous seedlings in temperate grassland. The fate of over 13 000 seedlings comprising seventeen plant species was studied in a grassland and meadow. Analysis examined two components of seedling herbivory: seedling encounter (the probability of at least one seedling being damaged) and seedling exploitation (the proportion of seedlings damaged once encountered). 2 The study examined the effect of season (spring and autumn), plant species as well as between- and within-habitat variation in the frequency and severity of herbivory attributable to the different guilds of herbivores. Detailed examination of plant species variation attempted to identify whether different guilds of herbivores share similar seedling 'preferences' and if certain seedling characteristics (such as size) make them more prone to herbivory. 3 Only molluscs and rodents encountered groups of seedlings to any significant extent, with arthropods playing only a minor role in seedling mortality. In spring, seedling herbivory was infrequent, with neither molluscs or rodents encountering more than 10% of seedlings in either habitat. In autumn there was an increased abundance of molluscs and rodents in both habitats. Seedling encounter by molluscs rose in both habitats but the clumped spatial distribution of rodent activity in the meadow led to seedling encounter by rodents increasing only in the grassland. Both molluscs and rodents appeared to encounter large seedlings more frequently than small seedlings leading to significant correlation in plant species encounter between these two guilds of herbivores. 4 In general, once a group of seedlings was encountered, molluscs and rodents exploited a similar number of seedlings, on average about 30%. With increasing seedling size, mollusc seedling exploitation decreased whereas in contrast, rodent seedling exploitation increased. Thus rodents exploited a greater proportion of large seedlings than molluscs and molluscs exploited a greater proportion of small seedlings. 5 Molluscs and rodents differed in the way they handled seedlings. Molluscs most frequently grazed seedlings, removing less than 75% of tissue, while rodents consumed seedlings completely. Forb seedlings (mostly legumes) tended to suffer less damage from herbivores than grasses. The possible influence of seedling defences in these feeding patterns is discussed and the relative roles of molluscs and rodents in seedling mortality in temperate habitats is assessed.},

   abstract = {Herbivores modify various ecological processes including interactions between native and exotic plants that may affect invasion success by the exotic plants. It is unknown whether different types of exotic herbivores have similar effects on native and exotic plants. Using two distinct data sets, we ran meta-analyses to compare exotic vertebrate and invertebrate herbivore preferences for, and effects on performance and population sizes of native and exotic plants. We found that exotic vertebrate herbivores have positive effects on exotic plant performance and population sizes, and no significant effects on native plants. Exotic invertebrates have significant negative effects on performance and population sizes of both exotic and native plants. Vertebrates prefer to feed on native plants relative to exotic plants, while invertebrates prefer the exotic plants to native plants. Thus the exotic vertebrate herbivores may aid invasiveness of exotic plants, in accordance with the invasional meltdown hypothesis, while exotic invertebrate herbivores probably have no net effect on invasion process of the exotic plants. Invertebrate herbivore preferences for exotic plants support the biotic resistance hypothesis, as the native plants probably resist the invertebrate herbivory. We also tested an evolutionary logic that posits that herbivores with similar evolutionary history as plants will affect the plants less negatively than plants with which they have not co-evolved. Our results indicate that there is no consistent pattern in effects of exotic vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores on exotic plants with or without which they have co-evolved.},

For the clones of Larix decidua and Quercus robur the duration of the growing season may decrease with increasing temperature, because leaf fall is advanced more than leaf unfolding, In Betula pubescens and Populus canescens, leaf unfolding and leaf fall are advanced equally, whereas in Tilia cordata and Fagus sylvatica the date of leaf fall seems to be unaltered but the date of leaf unfolding advances with increasing temperature, These differences in the duration of the growing season at increased temperature may alter the competitive balance between the species. Descriptive dynamic models showed that most of the variance in the date of leaf unfolding can be accounted for by temperature, However, a generally applicable model of leaf fall based on temperature and/or photoperiod could not improved the null model, i,e, the mean date of leaf fall, because of variability in other environmental factors. The lowest temperatures around the dates of leaf unfolding and leaf fall differed among the clones, The hypothesis that the survival of the clones is curtailed by spring frosts was supported, Thus, these lowest tempertures around leaf unfolding may represent thresholds below which the species cannot survive, It is argued that these thresholds may be a particularly sensitive means to evaluate the impact of climatic warming on the geographical distribution of tree species.},

   abstract = {Forests exchange large amounts of CO2 with the atmosphere and can influence and be influenced by atmospheric CO2. There has been a recent proliferation of literature on the effects of atmospheric CO2 on forest trees. More than 300 studies of trees on five different continents have been published in the last five years. These include an increasing number of field studies with a long-term focus and involving CO2 x stress or environment interactions. The recent data on long-term effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on trees indicate a potential for a persistent enhancement of tree growth for several years, although the only relevant long-term datasets currently available are for juvenile trees. The current literature indicates a significantly larger average long-term biomass increment under elevated CO2 for conifers (130%) than for deciduous trees (49%) in studies not involving stress components. However, stimulation of photosynthesis by elevated CO2 in long-term studies was similar for conifers (62 %) and deciduous trees (53 %). Recent studies indicate that elevated CO2 causes a more persistent stimulation of biomass increment and photosynthesis than previously expected. Results of seedling studies, however, might not be applicable to other stages of tree development because of complications of age-dependent and size-dependent shifts in physiology and carbon allocation, which are accelerated by elevated CO2. In addition, there are many possible avenues to down-regulation, making the predicted canopy CO2 exchange and growth of mature trees and forests in a CO2-rich atmosphere uncertain. Although, physiological down-regulation of photosynthetic rates has been documented in field situations, it is rarely large enough to offset entirely photosynthetic gains in elevated CO2. A persistent growth stimulation of individual mature trees has been demonstrated although this effect is more uncertain in trees in natural stands. Resource interactions can both constrain tree responses to elevated CO2 and be altered by them. Although drought can reduce gas-exchange rates and offset the benefits of elevated CO2, even in well watered trees, stomatal conductance is remarkably less responsive to elevated CO2 than in herbaceous species. Stomata of a number of tree species have been demonstrated to be unresponsive to elevated CO2. We conclude that positive effects of CO2 on leaf area can be at least as important in determining canopy transpiration as negative, direct effects of CO2 on stomatal aperture. With respect to nutrition, elevated CO2 has the potential to alter tree-soil interactions that might influence future changes in ecosystem productivity. There is continued evidence that in most cases nutrient limitations diminish growth and photosynthetic responses to elevated CO2 at least to some degree, and that elevated CO2 can accelerate the appearance of nutrient limitations with increasing time of treatment. In many studies, tree biomass responses to CO2 are artefacts in the sense that they are merely responses to CO2-induced changes in internal nutritional status of the tree. There are numerous interactions between CO2 and factors of the biotic and abiotic environment. The importance of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations for productivity is likely to be overestimated if these are not taken into account. Many interactions, however, are simply additive rather than synergistic or antagonistic. This appears to hold true for many parameters under elevated CO2 in combination with temperature, elevated O-3, and other atmospheric pollutants. However, there is currently little evidence that elevated CO2 will counteract O-3 damage. When the foliage content of C, mineral nutrients and secondary metabolites is altered by elevated CO2, tree x insect interactions are modified. In most trees, mycorrhizal interactions might be less important for direct effects of CO2 than for alleviating general nutrient deficiencies. Since many responses to elevated CO2 and their interactions with stress show considerable variability among species/genotypes, one principal research need is for comparative studies of a large variety of woody species and ecosystems under realistic conditions. We still need more long-term experiments on mature trees and stands to address critical scaling issues likely to advance our understanding of responses to elevated CO2 at different stages of forest development and their interactions with climate and environment. The only tools available at present for coping with the consequences of rising CO2 are management of resources and selection of genotypes suitable for the future climate and environment.},

   abstract = {Are mature forest trees carbon limited at current CO2 concentrations? Will 'mid-life', 35 m tall deciduous trees grow faster in a CO2-enriched atmosphere? To answer these questions we exposed ca. 100-year-old temperate forest trees at the Swiss Canopy Crane site near Basel, Switzerland to a ca. 540 ppm CO2 atmosphere using web-FACE technology. Here, we report growth responses to elevated CO2 for 11 tall trees (compared with 32 controls) of five species during the initial four treatment years. Tested across all trees, there was no CO2 effect on stem basal area (BA) increment (neither when tested per year nor cumulatively for 4 years). In fact, the 4th year means were almost identical for the two groups. Stem growth data were standardized by pretreatment growth (5 years) in order to account for a priori individual differences in vigor. Although this experiment was not designed to test species specific effects, one species, the common European beech, Fagus sylvatica, showed a significant growth enhancement in the first year, which reoccurred during a centennial drought in the third year. None of the other dominant species (Quercus petraea, Carpinus betulus) showed a growth response to CO2 in any of the 4 years or for all years together. The inclusion or exclusion of single individuals of Prunus avium and Tilia platyphyllos did not change the picture. In elevated CO2, lateral branching in terminal shoots was higher in Fagus in 2002, when shoots developed from buds that were formed during the first season of CO2 enrichment (2001), but there was no effect in later years and no change in lateral branching in any of the other species. In Quercus, there was a steady stimulation of leading shoot length in high-CO2 trees. Phenological variables (bud break, leaf fall, leaf duration) were highly species specific and were not affected by elevated CO2 in any consistent way. Our 4-year data set reflects a very dynamic and species-specific response of tree growth to a step change in CO2 supply. Stem growth after 4 years of exposure does not support the notion that mature forest trees will accrete wood biomass at faster rates in a future CO2 -enriched atmosphere. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {Inducible defenses are responses activated through a previous encounter with a consumer or competitor that confer some degree of resistance to subsequent attacks. While the importance of inducible resistance has long been known in host-parasite interactions, it is only recently that its importance has emerged in other natural systems. Although the structural defenses produced by invertebrates to their competitors and predators are by no means the same as an immune response triggered by parasites, these responses all share the properties of (1) specificity, (2) amplification and (3) memory. This review discusses the following ecological consequences and evolutionary causes of inducible defenses: (1) Inducible defenses render historical factors important in biological interactions and can affect the probability of individual survival and growth, as well as affect population dynamics of consumers in some circumstances. (2) Although the benefits of inducible defenses are often balanced by fitness costs, including reduced growth, reproductive output and survivorship, the role of costs and benefits in the evolution of inducible defenses is by no means clear. A more integrated approach would involve a multivariate analysis of the role of natural selection on the inducible characters of interest, their norms of reaction and correlated fitness characters. (3) The disproportionate representation of inducible, morphological defenses among clonal organisms may be due to both a higher rate of origination and enhanced selection to maintain these defenses in clonal taxa. (4) Inducible defenses should be most common when reliable cues are available, attacks by biological agents are unpredictable, and the fitness gains of defenses are balanced by the costs. An integrated approach to studying inducible defenses would thus combine mechanistic estimates of costs, population-level estimates of defense effectiveness, and genetic estimates of correlations between fitness and inducible characters. This will allow us to estimate rates of evolution in these phenotypically plastic threshold characters.},

   abstract = {The idea that the concentration of secondary metabolites in plant tissues is controlled by the availability of carbon and nitrogen in the environment has been termed the carbon-nutrient balance hypothesis (CNB). This hypothesis has been invoked both for prediction and for post hoc explanation of the results of hundreds of studies. Although it successfully predicts outcomes in some cases, it fails to such an extent that it cannot any longer be considered useful as a predictive tool. As information from studies has accumulated, many attempts have been made to save CNB, but these have been largely unsuccessful and have managed only to limit its utility. The failure of CNB is rooted in assumptions that are now known to be incorrect and it is time to abandon CNB because continued use of the hypothesis is now hindering understanding of plant-consumer interactions. In its place we propose development of theory with a firm evolutionary basis that is mechanistically sophisticated in terms of plant and herbivore physiology and genetics.},

Overall, herbivory by larvae of diamondback moths (Plutella xylostella) resulted in no change in glucosinolate levels of the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana under ambient CO(2) conditions. However, herbivory induced a significant 28-62% increase in glucosinolate contents at elevated CO(2). These inducible chemical responses were both genotype-specific and dependent on the individual glucosinolate considered. Elevated CO(2) can also affect structural defenses such as trichomes and insect-glucosinolate interactions. Insect performance was significantly influenced by specific glucosinolates, although only under CO(2) enrichment. This study can have implications for the evolution of inducible defenses and coevolutionary adaptations between plants and their associated herbivores in future changing environments.},

   abstract = {In its simplest definition, a trait is a surrogate of organismal performance, and this meaning of the term has been used by evolutionists for a long time. Over the last three decades, developments in community and ecosystem ecology have forced the concept of trait beyond these original boundaries, and trait-based approaches are now widely used in studies ranging from the level of organisms to that of ecosystems. Despite some attempts to fix the terminology, especially in plant ecology, there is currently a high degree of confusion in the use, not only of the term “trait” itself, but also in the underlying concepts it refers to. We therefore give an unambiguous definition of plant trait, with a particular emphasis on functional trait. A hierarchical perspective is proposed, extending the “performance paradigm” to plant ecology. “Functional traits” are defined as morpho-physio-phenological traits which impact fitness indirectly via their effects on growth, reproduction and survival, the three components of individual performance. We finally present an integrative framework explaining how changes in trait values due to environmental variations are translated into organismal performance, and how these changes may influence processes at higher organizational levels. We argue that this can be achieved by developing “integration functions” which can be grouped into functional response (community level) and effect (ecosystem level) algorithms.},

Empirical evidence in natural populations reveals that individual plants allocate resources simultaneously to both strategies, thus plants exhibit a mixed pattern of defense. In this review we examine the conditions that promote the evolutionary stability of mixed defense strategies in the light of available empirical and theoretical evidence. Given that plant tolerance and resistance are heritable and subject to environmentally dependent selection and genetic constraints, the joint evolution of tolerance and resistance is analyzed, with consideration of multiple species interactions and the plant mating system. The existence of mixed defense strategies in plants makes it necessary to re-explore the coevolutionary process between plants and herbivores, which centered historically on resistance as the only defensive mechanism. In addition, we recognize briefly the potential use of plant tolerance for pest management. Finally, we highlight unresolved issues for future development in this field of evolutionary ecology.},

The two nightshade species are rare and threatened by human activities. Adaptation to extreme aridity and soil salinity are evident in S. chilense and S. sitiens (the latter exhibits several xerophytic traits not seen in the tomatoes) and to low temperatures in S. lycopersico- ides and S. chilense. All tested accessions are self- incompatible, with the exception of one S. peruvianum population collected at the southern limit of its distribution. Several distinguishing reproductive traits—anther color, attachment, and dehiscence, pollen size, and flower scent—suggest S. sitiens and S. lycopersicoides attract different pollinators than S. chilense and S. peruvianum. The four Solanum spp. native or endemic to Chile provide a variety of novel traits which, through hybridization and introgression with cultivated tomato, could facilitate development of improved varieties, as well as research on a variety of basic topics, including plant-pollinator interactions, abiotic stress responses, and evolution of reproductive barriers.},

   abstract = {1. Although secondary metabolites are recognized as fundamental to the defence of plants against insect and mammalian herbivores, their relative importance compared to other potential defensive plant traits (e.g. physical resistance, gross morphology, life-history, primary chemistry and physiology) are not well understood. 2. We conducted a meta-analysis to answer the question: What types of genetically variable plant traits most strongly predict resistance against herbivores? We performed a comprehensive literature search and obtained 499 separate measurements of the strength of covariation (mea- sured as genetic correlations) between plant traits and herbivore susceptibility – these were extracted from 72 studies involving 19 plant families. 3. Surprisingly, we found no overall association between the concentrations of secondary metabolites and herbivore susceptibility – plant traits other than secondary metabolites most strongly predicted herbivore susceptibility. Specifically, genetic variation in life-history traits (e.g. flowering time, growth rate) consistently exhibited the strongest genetic correlations with susceptibility. Genetic variation in gross morphological traits (e.g. no. branches, plant size) and physical resistance traits (e.g. latex, trichomes) were also frequently correlated with variation in herbivore susceptibility, but these relationships depended on attributes of the herbivores (e.g. feeding guild) and plants (e.g. longevity). 4. These results call into question the conventional wisdom that secondary metabolites are the most important anti-herbivore defence of plants. We propose the hypothesis that herbivores select most strongly on genetic variation in life-history, morphological and physical resistance traits, but the greater pleiotropic effects of genes controlling these traits impose strong con- straints on their evolution. Meanwhile, secondary metabolites could have evolved to be impor- tant defensive mechanisms not because they have the largest effect on herbivores, but because the constraints on their evolution are the weakest.},

In order to reveal the effect of mixture we established 37 experimental plots in even-aged pure and mixed stands of Norway spruce and European beech covering an age span of 37-155 years. The site conditions ranged from warm, dry and base-rich to cool, wet and acidic sites. The ratio of above ground biomass growth of Norway spruce in relation to European beech decreases from 1.14: 1 in the monocultures to 1.04: 1 in the mixed stands. The mixing of spruce and beech results in a mutual stimulation of biomass production and acceleration of size growth. Together both species produce up to 59% more above ground biomass than the neighboring pure stands. On average the overyielding amounts to 21% in the case of Norway spruce and 37% in the case of European beech. A total of 67% out of the plots indicate overyielding and 57% transgressive overyielding. In mixed stands both species' tree sizes are significantly ahead of the corresponding pure stands. Facilitation of spruce and competitive reduction of beech yields mutualism with respect to growth on tree and stand level. Consequences for analyzing and modeling interspecific competition and for silvicultural prescriptions are discussed. Ecological implications of the mixing effect on the occurrence and stability of natural and man-made mixed stands of spruce and beech are considered},

   abstract = {Nearly all forest plantations are established as monocultures, but research has shown that there are potential advantages to be gained by using carefully designed species mixtures in place of monocultures. This paper reviews recent studies that compare stand development and productivity of mixed and pure plantations. Higher stand-level productivity in mixtures has been found with two kinds of species interactions: (1) complementary resource use between species that arises from development of a stratified canopy (and possibly root stratification); (2) facilitative improvement in nutrition of a valuable timber species growing in mixture with a nitrogen-fixing species (but only if combined with complementary resource use as well). These mixtures can also improve economic return through greater individual-tree growth rates and provision of multiple commercial or subsistence products. More complex plantation mixtures of 5-70 species have been used for ecological restoration of degraded lands; these large numbers of species of different successional stages are combined to reduce the need for a series of sequential plantings. Future research needs to examine many more tree species across a wider range of sites. Innovative planting designs have been developed to reduce the land area needed for mixed-species plantation experiments, by focusing on individual-tree analysis rather than plot-level analysis. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Leaf biomechanical properties have the potential to act as antiherbivore defences. However, compared with studies on chemical defences, there are few studies that have demonstrated that the physical or biomech- anical structure of plants can prevent or influence herbivory. This difference in focus by ecologists may relate to the dominant paradigm of plant chemical defences in ecological research and the perceived difficulties that ecol- ogists have with the engineering principles embedded in biomechanics. The advantage of using materials engin- eering concepts is that each property is precisely defined and quantifiable, although the latter may be difficult in leaves because of their composite and anisotropic nature. Most herbivory studies have used simple penetrometers to measure leaf properties, often termed ‘toughness’. As defined in materials engineering, the measured proper- ties are ‘force to fracture’ and ‘strength’, not toughness. Measurement of strength, the resistance to crack initi- ation, is relevant to understanding herbivory. Measurement of ‘toughness’ as defined by materials engineering is also relevant. Toughness is the resistance to crack propagation and is a measure of the energy required to fracture the leaf. This requires more sophisticated equipment than simple penetrometers because it requires a simultaneous measure of the punch displacement. In addition, purists would argue that a punch cannot be used to measure true toughness because the crack is not controlled and plastic deformation is also involved. However, it may be the only method that allows detection of fine-scale pattern in mechanical properties across a leaf surface at a scale that is relevant to herbivory. There is very little work on the scale at which these properties vary, particularly with regard to different sized herbivores. In addition, few studies have investigated a broad range of relevant biomechanical properties in relation to herbivory. Therefore, it is not possible yet to be definitive about the relative merits of the various types of tests. A single test might show a pattern in relation to herbivore damage at a gross level. However, to really understand the functional and ecological significance of leaf texture in relation to herbivory, a more reduc- tionist approach is needed. Only then can we move on to the larger scales of pattern that many ecologists are seeking.},

Understanding plastic responses is crucial for predicting and managing the effects of climate change on native species as well as crop plants. Here, we provide a toolbox with definitions of key theoretical elements and a synthesis of the current understanding of the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying plasticity relevant to climate change. By bringing ecological, evolutionary, physiological and molecular perspectives together, we hope to provide clear directives for future research and stimulate cross-disciplinary dialogue on the relevance of phenotypic plasticity under climate change. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

In general, leaf N and P decline and the N/P ratio increases toward the equator as average temperature and growing season length increase. These patterns are similar for five dominant plant groups, coniferous trees and four angiosperm groups (grasses, herbs, shrubs, and trees). These results support the hypotheses that (i) leaf N and P increase from the tropics to the cooler and drier midlatitudes because of temperature-related plant physiological stoichiometry and biogeographical gradients in soil substrate age and then plateau or decrease at high latitudes because of cold temperature effects on biogeochemistry and (ii) the N/P ratio increases with mean temperature and toward the equator, because P is a major limiting nutrient in older tropical soils and N is the major limiting nutrient in younger temperate and high-latitude soils.},

   abstract = {Comprehensive marine management approaches, such as ecosystem based management and marine spatial planning, would benefit from quantitative, spatially explicit estimates of the cumulative impact of human activities on marine ecosystems. In this study, a method to map and quantify cumulative impact was applied to estimate the combined impact of multiple stressors on Tauranga Harbour, a large estuary in New Zealand. The impact of eight stressors on seven ecosystems was assessed at a 100 m resolution, using New Zealand-specific expert judgement on the vulnerability of different ecosystems to each stressor. Estimated cumulative impact tended to be highest in the southern basin and inner estuaries, corresponding with sensitive ecosystems and multiple stressors and reflecting what is known about the distribution of pressures in Tauranga Harbour. Using benthic community data as an independent estimate of ecological condition, we had the novel opportunity to validate cumulative impact predicted from the model. Only a weak relationship was found between the estimated cumulative impact and measured ecological condition and several reasons for this are considered. Substitution of a more realistic sediment layer improved model outputs, highlighting the importance of accurate input data, particularly for stressors or ecosystems with high impact weights. Different standardisation methods did not greatly affect the spatial distribution of cumulative impact patterns in the harbour. The study highlights some fundamental issues for consideration when using this cumulative impact mapping approach, such as the importance of involving the expert panel throughout the course of the study and the availability and quality of the data used to construct the model.},

   abstract = {As recently reinforced in the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), knowledge on the location and intensity of human impacts on marine ecosystems is critical for effective marine management and conservation. Human interaction with ecosystems has to be accounted for in order to efficiently implement marine management strategies. In the present study, the main human activities occurring along the mainland Portuguese coast were identified and mapped. The cumulative impact of these activities was calculated in order to assess impacts in different zones, namely in Marine Protected Areas (MPA) and their boundaries. Higher impact values were obtained near the coast, where all the analysed MPAs are located. Furthermore, most MPAs are sorrounded by areas with very high impacts, near the largest urban settlements and the most industrialized coastal sections. These results are the first assessment of cumulative human pressures in this study area as a whole (and with this level of resolution) and might be of great usefulness to overcome the current challenges of sustainable management in marine ecosystems. Knowledge provided by this study strengthens the need for a more integrative approach to design and manage MPAs and can be useful to support the requirements of the MSFD. The approach here developed is also a powerful tool to apply in several contexts of sustainable marine management and can be developed in any geographic area.},

   abstract = {It is often said that the aim of risk assessment is to faithfully represent and report the knowledge of some defined experts in the field studied. The analysts job is to elicit this knowledge, synthesise it and report the results as integrated uncertainty assessments, for example, expressed through a set of probability distributions. Analysts judgements beyond these tasks should not be incorporated in the uncertainty assessments (distributions). The purpose of the present paper is to discuss the rationale of this perspective. To conduct a risk assessment in practice the analysts need to make a number of judgements related to, for example, the choice of methods and models that to a large extent influence the results. And often the analysts are the real experts on many of the issues addressed in the assessments, in particular, when it comes to understanding how various phenomena and processes interact. Would it then not be more appropriate to fully acknowledge the role of the analysts as uncertainty assessors and probability assigners, and see the results of the risk assessments as their judgements based on input from the experts? The discussion is illustrated by two examples. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All Rights Reserved.},

With this aim, Bootstrap approaches are suggested in the current work, specifically designed for their application to spatial data, as they take into account the dependence structure of the underlying random process. The key idea is to construct nonparametric distribution estimators, adapted to the spatial setting, which are distribution functions themselves, associated to discrete or continuous random variables. Then, the Bootstrap samples are obtained by drawing at random from the estimated distribution. Consistency of the suggested approaches will be proved by assuming stationarity from the random process or by relaxing the latter hypothesis to admit a deterministic trend. Numerical studies for simulated data and a real data set, obtained from environmental monitoring, are included to illustrate the application of the proposed Bootstrap methods.},

   abstract = {Abstract—Evaluation of environmental risks posed by potentially hazardous substances requires achieving a balance between over- and underprotection, i.e., between societal benefits posed by the use of particular substances and their potential risks. Uncertainty (e.g., only laboratory data may be available, field or epidemiological data may be limited and less than clear-cut, etc.) will always exist and is often conservatively dealt with by the use of so-called ‘‘safety’’ or ‘‘uncertainty’’ factors, some of which remain relatively little changed since their origin in 1945. Extrapolations involving safety factors for both aquatic and terrestrialenvironments include inter- and intraspecies, acute-to-chronic, lowest- to no-observed-effect concentration (NOEC), and laboratory-to-field ex- trapolation (e.g., extrapolation of laboratory results to the field). To be realistic, such extrapolations need to have a clear relationship with the field effect of concern and to be based on good science. The end result is, in any case, simply an estimate of a field NOEC, not an actual NOEC. Science-based versus policy-driven safety factors, including their uses and limitations, are critically examined in the context of national and international legislation on risk assessment. Key recommendations include providing safety factors as a potential threshold effects range instead of a discrete number and using experimental results rather than defaulting to safety factors to compensate for lack of information. This latter recommendation has the additional value of rendering safety factors predictive rather than simply protective. We also consider the so-called ‘‘Precautionary Principle,’’ which originated in 1980 and effectively addresses risk by proposing that the safety factor should be infinitely large},

   abstract = {Catchment managers face considerable challenges in managing ecological assets. This task is made difficult by the variable and complex nature of ecological assets, and the considerable uncertainty involved in quantifying how various threats and hazards impact upon them. Bayesian approaches have the potential to address the modelling needs of environmental management. However, to date many Bayesian networks (Bn) developed for environmental management have been parameterised using knowledge elicitation only. Not only are these models highly qualitative, but the time and effort involved in elicitation of a complex Bn can often be overwhelming. Unfortunately in environmental applications, data alone are often too limited for parameterising a Bn. Consequently, there is growing interest in how to parameterise Bns using both data and elicited information. At present, there is little formal guidance on how to combine what can be learned from the data with what can be elicited. In a previous publication we proposed a detailed methodology for this process, focussing on parameterising and evaluating a Bn. In this paper, we further develop this methodology using a risk assessment case study, with the focus being on native fish communities in the Goulburn Catchment (Victoria, Australia). © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Worldwide increasing pressure on the marine environment requires integrated and ecosystem-based management, and a sound understanding of cumulative impacts of human pressure. As yet, the quantification of risk of cumulative impact remains a difficult task in practice. We developed a geospatial modelling framework to group data on the spatial distribution and intensity of human activities by generic pressure. The impact of those pressures was mapped by accounting for the sensitivity of UK marine landscapes to those pressures. With the help of GIS-based multi-criteria analysis, we developed 4 different scenarios to quantify risk of cumulative impacts that accounted for different importance of ranked pressures (equal, linear and logistic decrease), including a simulated expert consultation. Finally, we assessed the sensitivity of the scenario outcomes to changes to input parameters and compared model outcomes. The risk assessment framework exposed both a wide range of possible modelled scenarios and uncertainties, but all scenarios revealed similar locations with an increased risk of cumulative impacts. Results showed that the logistic weighting scheme was very sensitive to changes in the importance and ranking of pressures in comparison to the linear weighting scheme. For marine planning the use of a weighting scheme with more constrained values should be used in conjunction with a sensitivity analysis to determine the order of input parameters. Once a more comprehensive geodatabase becomes available our standardised framework can be applied to support both the development of sustainable marine plans in practise and the prioritisation of different uses.},

In this review, we have analysed 36 recent marine CPIAs and focused on their methodological approaches. We were especially interested in uncovering methodological similarities, identifying best practices and analysing whether the CPIAs have addressed the recent criticism. The review results showed surprisingly similar methodological approaches in >50% of the studies, raising hopes for finding coherence in international assessment efforts.

New, updated datasets and methodological improvements over the previous analysis were completed, including a new index for land-based effects on marine habitats, updated habitat classes and a modified treatment of vulnerability scores. The results show increased potential cumulative effects for the region. Fishing remains the biggest overall impact amongst marine activities, while land-based activities have the highest impact per unit area in affected ocean areas. Intertidal areas were the most affected habitat per unit area, while pelagic habitats had the highest total cumulative effect score. Regular updates of cumulative effects assessments will make them more useful for management, but these require regularly updated, high resolution datasets across all activity types, and automated, well-documented procedures to make them accessible to managers and policy-makers.},

   abstract = {For the UK continental shelf we developed a Bayesian Belief Network-GIS framework to visualise relationships between cumulative human pressures, sensitive marine landscapes and landscape vulnerability, to assess the consequences of potential marine planning objectives, and to map uncertainty-related changes in management measures. Results revealed that the spatial assessment of footprints and intensities of human activities had more influence on landscape vulnerabilities than the type of landscape sensitivity measure used. We addressed questions regarding consequences of potential planning targets, and necessary management measures with spatially-explicit assessment of their consequences. We conclude that the BN-GIS framework is a practical tool allowing for the visualisation of relationships, the spatial assessment of uncertainty related to spatial management scenarios, the engagement of different stakeholder views, and enables a quick update of new spatial data and relationships. Ultimately, such BN-GIS based tools can support the decision-making process used in adaptive marine management. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Humans impact natural systems in a multitude of ways, yet the cumulative effect of multiple stressors on ecological communities remains largely unknown. Here we synthesized 171 studies that manipulated two or more stressors in marine and coastal systems and found that cumulative effects in individual studies were additive (26%), synergistic (36%), and antagonistic (38%). The overall interaction effect across all studies was synergistic, but interaction type varied by response level (community: antagonistic, population: synergistic), trophic level (autotrophs: antagonistic, heterotrophs: synergistic), and specific stressor pair (seven pairs additive, three pairs each synergistic and antagonistic). Addition of a third stressor changed interaction effects significantly in two-thirds of all cases and doubled the number of synergistic interactions. Given that most studies were performed in laboratories where stressor effects can be carefully isolated, these three-stressor results suggest that synergies may be quite common in nature where more than two stressors almost always coexist. While significant gaps exist in multiple stressor research, our results suggest an immediate need to account for stressor interactions in ecological studies and conservation planning.},

   abstract = {Statistical and dynamical downscaling techniques have been proposed to bridge the gaps between coarse-scale and generally biased climate model outputs and the point-scale requirements of impact model inputs. Amongst the various statistical approaches, empirical downscaling methods are the most commonly used due to their ease of implementation. Several empirical downscaling approaches have been proposed and need to be assessed as to which method contributes (or not) to the overall climate change uncertainty. Accordingly, this work aims at assessing the uncertainty of six empirical downscaling methods in quantifying the hydrological impact of climate change over two North American river basins under different climate conditions. The six empirical downscaling methods are grouped into change factor (two methods) and bias correction (four methods) approaches. The uncertainty related to the choice of an empirical downscaling method is compared to that associated with the choice of climate simulation, through the use of two Regional Climate Models (RCMs) driven by three different General Circulation Models (GCMs), totaling four RCM simulations, taken from the NARCCAP inter-comparison project. The future (2041-2065) hydrological regimes simulated with an empirical lumped hydrology model (HSAMI) are compared to the reference period (1971-1995) using a set of hydrology criteria which includes statistics of both mean and extreme values. The results show a large uncertainty envelope associated with the choice of a given empirical downscaling method, as well as for the choice of an RCM simulation. The uncertainty due to empirical downscaling and RCM simulation was more significant in projecting extreme streamflow than in projecting mean flows. Comparing the uncertainty envelope of empirical downscaling methods to the envelope resulting from four RCM simulations indicates that both are similar, even though the latter was slightly larger for some statistics. Finally, the uncertainty linked to the choice of an empirical downscaling approach (change factor vs. bias correction) was much larger than within each type. Overall, this work emphasizes the importance of using several climate projections and empirical downscaling approaches to delineate uncertainty when assessing the climate change impacts on hydrology. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

We provide practical guidelines for developing, testing, and revising BBNs. Primary steps in this process include creating influence diagrams of the hypothesized “causal web” of key factors affecting a species or ecological outcome of interest; developing a first, alpha-level BBN model from the influence diagram; revising the model after expert review; testing and calibrating the model with case files to create a beta-level model; and updating the model structure and conditional probabilities with new validation data, creating the final-application gamma-level model. We illustrate and discuss these steps with an empirically based BBN model of factors influencing probability of capture of northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus (Shaw)). Testing and updating BBNs, especially with peer review and calibration, are essential to ensure their credibility and reduce bias.

   abstract = {AimMany studies have quantified and mapped cumulative human impacts on
marine ecosystems. These maps are intended to inform management and
planning, but uncertainty in them has not been studied in depth. This
paper aims to: (1) quantify the uncertainty in cumulative impact maps
and related spatial modelling results; (2) attribute this uncertainty to
specific model assumptions and problems with data quality; (3) identify
and test sound approaches to such analyses.
LocationWe used the Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean and Black Seas as
example regions. The methods and conclusions are relevant for human
impact mapping anywhere.
MethodsWe conducted computational experiments to test the effects of
nine model assumptions and data quality problems (factors) on maps of
human impact and related modelling results. The factors were implemented
on the basis of a literature review. We quantified aggregate uncertainty
using Monte Carlo simulations, and ranked the factors by their influence
on modelling results using the elementary effects method. Both methods
are well established and theoretically suitable for complex models, but
had to be modified for application to spatial human impact models.
ResultsSome, but not all, modelling results were robust. This
contradicts previous studies that found only minor effects of the
factors they tested. Of the nine factors tested here, eight had a
considerable influence on at least one modelling result in at least one
of the two study regions.
Main conclusionsModel assumptions and data quality have larger aggregate
effects on maps of human impact than found in previous analyses. These
effects depend on the study region and the data that describe it. Future
human impact mapping studies should thus include comprehensive
uncertainty analyses. Computational experiments allow us to distinguish
robust from less reliable modelling results and to prioritize
improvements in models and data.},

Maritime spatial planning (MSP) is envisaged as a tool to apply an ecosystem-based approach to the marine and coastal realms, aiming at ensuring that the collective pressure of human activities is kept within acceptable limits. Cumulative impacts (CI) assessment can support science-based MSP, in order to understand the existing and potential impacts of human uses on the marine environment. A CI assessment includes several sources of uncertainty that can hinder the correct interpretation of its results if not explicitly incorporated in the decision-making process. This study proposes a three-level methodology to perform a general uncertainty analysis integrated with the CI assessment for MSP, applied to the Adriatic and Ionian Region (AIR). We describe the nature and level of uncertainty with the help of expert judgement and elicitation to include all of the possible sources of uncertainty related to the CI model with assumptions and gaps related to the case-based MSP process in the AIR. Next, we use the results to tailor the global uncertainty analysis to spatially describe the uncertainty distribution and variations of the CI scores dependent on the CI model factors. The results show the variability of the uncertainty in the AIR, with only limited portions robustly identified as the most or the least impacted areas under multiple model factors hypothesis. The results are discussed for the level and type of reliable information and insights they provide to decision-making. The most significant uncertainty factors are identified to facilitate the adaptive MSP process and to establish research priorities to fill knowledge gaps for subsequent planning cycles. The method aims to depict the potential CI effects, as well as the extent and spatial variation of the data and scientific uncertainty; therefore, this method constitutes a suitable tool to inform the potential establishment of the precautionary principle in MSP.},

   abstract = {Marine spatial planning (MSP) is advocated to support an ecosystem approach to marine management, as it allows consideration of multiple management objectives including marine conservation. The monitoring and evaluation of both implemented marine plans and the planning process itself is susceptible to various uncertainties. Here, uncertainties related to a stepwise monitoring and evaluation framework for spatially managed areas were characterised and quantified with the help of two modified and developed tools. In particular, Walker-type and pedigree matrices were utilised to assess both the sources and respective relative levels of uncertainty present in the assessment of nine European case studies that conducted a stepwise monitoring and evaluation process applying a common framework. Across the southern and northern European case studies major sources of uncertainty were found in relation to the knowledge base, management scenarios with related objectives and data availability. Although case studies made flexible use of the framework to account for the particularities of the local realms, the revealed pattern of associated uncertainty was highly consistent across the case studies. The scored pedigree matrices showed that the criteria 'stakeholder engagement' and 'cross validation' had greatest influence on the overall robustness of the case study assessments. The observed distribution of median pedigree scores was within acceptable ranges with respect to simulated possible score distributions. In addition, a sensitivity analysis revealed that the scoring of the pedigree criteria by five or more experts would result in less variable interquartile ranges of respective median scores. In conclusion, the developed complementary tools showed great flexibility in characterising and assessing uncertainty despite context-dependent differences among case studies such as geographical area, quality of available data, level of spatial management implementation or management objectives. Moreover, the obtained findings allow prioritising efforts and future research to support an iterative monitoring and evaluation of marine spatial plans.},

   abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects <70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

   abstract = {Aim A large body of knowledge exists on individual anthropogenic threats that have an impact on marine biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea, although we know little about how these threats accumulate and interact to affect marine species and ecosystems. In this context, we aimed to identify the main areas where the interaction between marine biodiversity and threats is more pronounced and to assess their spatial overlap with current marine protected areas in the Mediterranean. Location Mediterranean Sea. Methods We first identified areas of high biodiversity of marine mammals, marine turtles, seabirds, fishes and commercial or well-documented invertebrates. We mapped potential areas of high threat where multiple threats are occurring simultaneously. Finally we quantified the areas of conservation concern for biodiversity by looking at the spatial overlap between high biodiversity and high cumulative threats, and we assessed the overlap with protected areas. Results Our results show that areas with high marine biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea are mainly located along the central and north shores, with lower values in the south-eastern regions. Areas of potential high cumulative threats are widespread in both the western and eastern basins, with fewer areas located in the south-eastern region. The interaction between areas of high biodiversity and threats for invertebrates, fishes and large animals in general (including large fishes, marine mammals, marine turtles and seabirds) is concentrated in the coastal areas of Spain, Gulf of Lions, north-eastern Ligurian Sea, Adriatic Sea, Aegean Sea, south-eastern Turkey and regions surrounding the Nile Delta and north-west African coasts. Areas of concern are larger for marine mammal and seabird species. Main conclusions These areas may represent good candidates for further research, management and protection activities, since there is only a maximum 2% overlap between existing marine protected areas (which cover 5% of the Mediterranean Sea) and our predicted areas of conservation concern for biodiversity.},

   abstract = {This study was designed to test for synergism (increased stress) or antagonism (decreased stress) among multiple environmental stressors using additive, multiplicative, and simple comparative effects models. Model predictions were compared to empirical results of laboratory experiments measuring interactions among thermal stress, toxin exposure, and low food on reproduction and survival of two species of cladoceran zooplankton. Stress was defined operationally as a reduction in reproduction or survival relative to optimal conditions over a 7-d period. These experiments are particularly applicable to episodic stresses such as those associated with short-term heat waves. Toxin or low food in combination with 30⚬C temperatures were generally more harmful than high temperature alone. However, most multiple stress effects were antagonistic, in that effects in combination were not as severe as predicted based on the sum or the product of their individual effects. In rare cases, interaction among stressors even diminished effects of the worst single stressor. Optimal conditions for reproduction and survival occurred at 25⚬C, high food and 0 mg liter-1 toxin (a surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate). Suppressive effects of stressors examined individually ranked: high temperature (30 $^\circ C) >$ SDS (10 mg liter-1 ≥ low food (∼ 100 μg C liter $^\{-1\}) >$ low temperature (20⚬C). Daphnia pulex isolated from a pond which experiences high summer temperatures throughout was more tolerant of 30⚬C conditions than Daphnia pulicaria isolated from a lake with a cold-water refuge. Differences were observed in individuals exposed as either adults or as 24-h neonates.},

   abstract = {Marine ecosystems are increasingly threatened by the cumulative effects of multiple human pressures. Cumulative effect assessments (CEAs) are needed to inform environmental policy and guide ecosystem-based management. Yet, CEAs are inherently complex and seldom linked to real-world management processes. Therefore we propose entrenching CEAs in a risk management process, comprising the steps of risk identification, risk analysis and risk evaluation. We provide guidance to operationalize a risk-based approach to CEAs by describing for each step guiding principles and desired outcomes, scientific challenges and practical solutions. We reviewed the treatment of uncertainty in CEAs and the contribution of different tools and data sources to the implementation of a risk based approach to CEAs. We show that a risk-based approach to CEAs decreases complexity, allows for the transparent treatment of uncertainty and streamlines the uptake of scientific outcomes into the science-policy interface. Hence, its adoption can help bridging the gap between science and decision-making in ecosystem-based management.},

Based on a spatio-temporal analysis using a Geographic Information System (GIS), this study aims to assess the cumulative human impacts of local activities on this dolphin population since 1996. After introducing and discussing the multiple approaches, difficulties, and limitations to cumulative effects assessments (CEA), this paper outlines our proposed CEA methodology. Our methodology involves mapping and analysis of anthropogenic marine impacts in relation with historical dolphin distributions in the area. Local scale results show evidence of a relationship between the addition of new high-speed ferry (HSF) routes into the cumulative environment and the decrease in dolphins in a specific region known as the Brothers Islands. These results coincide with past research showing that whales and dolphins are significantly disrupted in the presence of high vessel traffic, which continues to grow in the northern waters off Lantau Island, Hong Kong and in many other places around the world. s},

   abstract = {Effective ecosystem-based management requires understanding ecosystem responses to multiple human threats, rather than focusing on single threats. To understand ecosystem responses to anthropogenic threats holistically, it is necessary to know how threats affect different components within ecosystems and ultimately alter ecosystem functioning. We used a case study of a Mediterranean seagrass (Posidonia oceanica) food web and expert knowledge elicitation in an application of the initial steps of a framework for assessment of cumulative human impacts on food webs. We produced a conceptual seagrass food web model, determined the main trophic relationships, identified the main threats to the food web components, and assessed the components’ vulnerability to those threats. Some threats had high (e.g., coastal infrastructure) or low impacts (e.g., agricultural runoff) on all food web components, whereas others (e.g., introduced carnivores) had very different impacts on each component. Partitioning the ecosystem into its components enabled us to identify threats previously overlooked and to reevaluate the importance of threats commonly perceived as major. By incorporating this understanding of system vulnerability with data on changes in the state of each threat (e.g., decreasing domestic pollution and increasing fishing) into a food web model, managers may be better able to estimate and predict cumulative human impacts on ecosystems and to prioritize conservation actions. Hacia un Marco de Trabajo para la Evaluación y el Manejo de los Impactos Humanos Acumulativos sobre las Redes Alimenticias Marinas Resumen El manejo efectivo con base en los ecosistemas requiere entender la respuesta de los ecosistemas a múltiples amenazas humanas en lugar de enfocarse en amenazas individuales. Para entender holísticamente la respuesta de los ecosistemas a las múltiples amenazas antropogénicas es necesario saber cómo estas amenazas afectan a los diferentes componentes dentro de los ecosistemas y cómo alteran finalmente el funcionamiento de los ecosistemas. Usamos el estudio de caso de la red alimenticia del pasto marino del Mediterráneo (Posidonia oceanica) y la obtención de conocimiento de expertos en una aplicación de los pasos iniciales de un método para la evaluación de los impactos humanos acumulativos sobre las redes alimenticias. Produjimos un modelo de red alimenticia de pastos marinos, determinamos las principales relaciones tróficas, identificamos a las principales amenazas para los componentes de la red y evaluamos la vulnerabilidad de los componentes a esas amenazas. Algunas amenazas tuvieron impactos altos (p. ej.: infraestructura costera) o bajos (p. ej.: escorrentía agrícola) sobre todos los componentes de la red, mientras que otros (p. ej.: carnívoros introducidos) tuvieron impactos muy diferentes sobre cada componente. Partir al ecosistema en sus componentes nos permitió identificar amenazas no vistas previamente y reevaluar la importancia de las amenazas percibidas comúnmente como mayores. Al incorporar este entendimiento de la vulnerabilidad del sistema con datos sobre los cambios en el estado de cada amenaza (p. ej.: disminución de la contaminación doméstica e incremento de la pesca) al modelo de red alimenticia, los manejadores pueden ser capaces de estimar y predecir de mejor manera los impactos humanos acumulativos sobre los ecosistemas y priorizar las acciones de conservación.},

   abstract = {In 1991 Morris proposed an effective screening sensitivity measure to identify the few important factors in models with many factors. The method is based on computing for each input a number of incremental ratios, namely elementary effects, which are then averaged to assess the overall importance of the input. Despite its value, the method is still rarely used and instead local analyses varying one factor at a time around a baseline point are usually employed. In this piece of work we propose a revised version of the elementary effects method, improved in terms of both the definition of the measure and the sampling strategy. In the present form the method shares many of the positive qualities of the variance-based techniques, having the advantage of a lower computational cost, as demonstrated by the analytical examples. The method is employed to assess the sensitivity of a chemical reaction model for dimethylsulphide (DMS), a gas involved in climate change. Results of the sensitivity analysis open up the ground for model reconsideration: some model components may need a more thorough modelling effort while some others may need to be simplified. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, the essential mechanisms of community assembly in these systems remain largely unexplored. In the current paper we investig- ate the coexistence ofAleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) and Holm oak (Quercus ilex L.), two of the mostwidely distributed species in the Iberian Peninsula, in relation to gradients in water availability and disturbance. A spatial model of landscape forest dynamics was implemented, calibrated with experimental data, with stands arranged on a heterogeneous lattice and coupled by dispersal. It was found that pine population persistence in the landscape can be explained independently by a competition-colonization tradeoff (in mesic homogeneous environments) and by a tradeoff between shade and drought tolerance (in heterogeneous low disturbed environments). Both mechanisms reinforcemutually to maintain a shifting mosaic of both taxa along disturbance and aridity gradients. This view is consistent with palynological, historical and forest inventory records. In turn, equilibrium theories of vegetation dynamics (phytosociological), that neglect the role of heterogeneity and disturbances may be inadequate forMediterranean forests, and have been shown to result in mismanagement practices.We claim that biologically informed models of forest dynamics are desperately needed as diagnosis tools for sustainable forest management.},

   abstract = {Ecological models are increasingly used as decision-making tools and their reliability is becoming a key issue. At the same time, the sophistication of techniques for model development and analysis has given rise to a relative compartmentalization of model building and evaluation tasks. Several guidelines invite ecological modelers to follow an organized sequence of development and analysis steps and have coined the term "evaludation" for this process. The objective of this paper is to assess the feasibility and the value of a structured evaludation process, based on the working example of the Samsara2 model, a spatially explicit individual-based forest dynamics model. We implemented the six steps of model design, process level calibration, qualitative evaluation, quantitative evaluation, global sensitivity analysis, and partial recalibration using approximate Bayesian computing. We then evaluated how the evaludation process revealed model strengths and weaknesses, specified the model's conditions of use, clarified how the model works, and provided insights into forest ecosystem functioning. Finally, the efficiency/cost ratio of the process and future improvements are discussed.},

   abstract = {Grid-based inventories of 1,924 deciduous forests plots in Germany and 4,775 in Romania were used to investigate tree species composition as affected by browsing and grazing under different forest management (rotation forestry, selectively cut forest, protected forest). At regional scale, the loss of tree species in the dominant layer was between 52 to 67% in Germany and of 10 to 30% in Romania, with largest effects in protected nature reserves in Germany. At plot level, only 50% (Germany) to 54% (Romania) of canopy species were found in the regeneration layer with a height of 1.5 m. Browsing was influenced by the proportion of Fagus in the regenerating trees in Germany, and by stand density, basal area, and management in both regions. Structural equation modeling explained 11 to 26% of the variance in species loss based on the fresh loss of the terminal bud in the winter prior to the inventory work (one season browsing). Browsing (and grazing in Romania) is shown to be a significant cause of species loss across both countries and all management types. Potential cascading effects on other organisms of deciduous forest ecosystems are discussed. We conclude that the present hunting practices that support overabundant ungulate populations constitute a major threat to the biodiversity of deciduous forests in Germany and Romania and to other places with similar ungulate management, and that changes my only be possible by modernizing the legal framework of hunting.},

   abstract = {Management of large herbivores could be improved by investing less effort in estimating absolute abundance and more effort tracking variation over time of indicators of ecological change (IEC) describing animal performance, herbivore impact on habitat, and relative animal abundance. To describe relative changes in animal abundance, monitoring trends in numbers through indices may constitute a useful and low cost method, especially at large spatial scales. Reliability of indices to detect trends should be evaluated before they are used in wildlife management. We compared population trends estimated from spotlight counts, a standard census method for deer populations, with population size estimates of a red deer Cervus elaphus population monitored using Capture-Mark-Recapture (CMR) methodology. We found a strong negative effect of conditions of observation (e.g. rainfall) on both the number of animals (-24.4%) and the number of groups (-31.6%) seen per kilometre. After controlling for observation conditions, we found that these two abundance indices were linearly correlated with CMR estimates, with the group-based index being better correlated (r = 0.75) than the individual-based index (r = 0.68). These consistent trends between indices and CM R estimates provide support in using standardised spotlight counts as an IEC describing relative changes in abundance for the monitoring and management of red deer populations.},

   abstract = {During a long term study (10 years) of an increasing forest roe deer Capreolus capreolus (Linnaeus, 1758) population, the reliability of a kilometric index for monitoring population size was tested. Kilometric index was defined by the ratio "number of observed animals/number of kilometers" of standardized transect. Three indexes were constructed: one for each transect, one for a transect set and one for all transects performed during a year. Actual population size was estimated each year by capture - mark - recapture. A modification of Petersen - Lincoln Index allowing long-term use was applied as the reference method. The relationship between annual kilometric index and population size estimation was assessed by calibrating index using linear and logistic regression. Moreover, we looked for different population levels using analyses of variance applied on the different indexes. Although high correlation was obtained between annual kilometric index and reference method, calibration equation led to unreliable population schedule. This demonstrated differential sensitivity of kilometric index according to population levels. Three population levels were discriminated by analyses of variance: a low population level during the four first years, a transition level corresponding to the fifth year and a high population level during the five last years. Indexes defined on a transect set (called "photo") appeared as the more informative. Such a study showed that to look for differential population levels from abundance indexes (bioindicator conception) is more pertinent than to establish conversion equations (calibration conception) in order to monitor forest roe deer population.},

Field experiments were conducted on the floor of a closed stand dominated by Tsuga on Mt Fuji to examine the seedling survival of Abies veitchii and Tsuga diversifolia in seven substrate types in relation to the morphological characteristics of the seeds and seedlings. Neither Abies nor Tsuga seedlings could survive on dwarf-bamboo litter beyond 2 years after the seed rain. Abies seedlings survived not only in all types of bryophyte communities but also in larch litter. In contrast, the survival of Tsuga seedlings was restricted to communities of smaller-statured bryophytes found on logs. The seeds and 1st year seedlings of A. veitchii were larger than those of T. diversifolia. Abies seedlings produced hypocotyls taller than any bryophyte community and radicles which were long enough to penetrate into the moist humus layer, whereas Tsuga seedling radicles presumably penetrate into humus only in bryophyte communities forming a thin mat on logs. The effect of bryophytes on survival of tree seedlings therefore depends on the relationships between the morphology of seeds and seedlings and the structure of bryophyte communities. © 1992 Ecological Society of Japan.},

Using contemporary coexistence theory that emphasizes stabilizing niche differences and relative fitness differences, we evaluate three empirical approaches for studying community assembly. We show that experimental manipulations of the abiotic or biotic environ-ment, assessments of trait-phylogeny-environment relationships, and inves-tigations of frequency-dependent population growth all suggest strong influ-ences of stabilizing niche differences and fitness differences on the outcome of plant community assembly. Nonetheless, due to the limitations of these approaches applied in isolation, we still have a poor understanding of which niche axes and which traits determine the outcome of competition and com-munity structure. Combining current approaches represents our best chance of achieving this goal, which is fundamental to conceptual ecology and to the management of plant communities under global change.},

   abstract = {Interactions between vascular plants and bryophytes determine plant community composition in many ecosystems. Yet, little is known about the importance of interspecific differences between bryophytes with respect to their effects on vascular plants. We compared the extent to which species-specific bryophyte effects on vascular plant generative recruitment depend on the following underlying mechanisms: allelopathy, mechanical obstruction, soil moisture and temperature control. We sowed 10 vascular plant species into monospecific mats of six chemically and structurally diverse bryophytes, and examined 1-yr seedling recruitment. Allelopathic effects were also assessed in a laboratory phyto-assay. Although all bryophytes suppressed vascular plant regeneration, there were significant differences between the bryophyte species. The lack of interactions indicated the absence of species-specific adaptations of vascular plants for recruitment in bryophyte mats. Differences between bryophyte species were best explained by alterations in temperature regime under bryophyte mats, mostly by reduced temperature amplitudes during germination. The temperature regime under bryophyte mats was well predicted by species-specific bryophyte cushion thickness. The fitness of established seedlings was not affected by the presence of bryophytes. Our results suggest that climatically or anthropogenically driven changes in the species' composition of bryophyte communities have knock-on effects on vascular plant populations via generative reproduction.},

   abstract = {Species-rich native grasslands in western Victoria, Australia, are often small, have a high perimeter to area ratio and are surrounded by non-native species. Few non-native species, however, have invaded them. A feature of species-rich grasslands is the presence of a bryophyte mat (composed of mosses and liverworts) that carpets the intertussock spaces. I assessed the role of these mats in plant invasions by sowing three non-native species (Briza maxima, Hypochoeris radicata, Plantago lanceolata) in replicated disturbed (mats removed) and undisturbed (mats intact) microsites at three grassland remnants (two recently burnt, one unburnt for 3 years) and followed seedling emergence, survival and growth for 5 months. Three native species were also sown for comparison. The rate of germination and total percent germination of non-native species were significantly enhanced at both burnt sites when the mat was disturbed. The large-seeded Briza maxima failed to germinate at both burnt sites in the absence of soil disturbance. The native species generally did not show a strong germination or growth response to soil disturbance in burnt areas. At the unburnt site, where monthly percent soil moisture was highest, final percent germination of the non-native and native species was greatest of any site in both microsites, and germination was not significantly affected by soil disturbance. Differences in the seed morphology of native and non-native species may play an important role in their ability to establish on bryophyte mats in moisture-limiting environments. Any activity that disrupts the mats in the frequently burnt, species-rich grassland remnants is likely to significantly enhance the germination and subsequent growth by non-natives. However, where burning is infrequent, germination of some non-native species may be expected, regardless of disturbance, although growth will likely be favoured in disturbed areas.},

   abstract = {Questions: In a system of five annual plant species restricted to nest-mounds of the ant Lasius flavus in a perennial grassland: 1. Are the population dynamics influenced by ant disturbance? 2. Is the survival of the annuals at the scale of the whole grassland possible under the observed conditions of disturbance dynamics? 3. Which phases in the annuals' life cycle and patch types contribute most to population growth? Location: Borec hill, northern Czechia, 50 degrees 31' N, 13 degrees 59' E, 446 m a.s.l. Methods: Local population dynamics of the annuals were analysed separately for five patch types that differed in the proportion of bare soil. Vitality rates were assessed directly in the field, but also in a garden experiment, during 2000-2001 and 2001-2002. Population dynamics at the scale of the whole grassland was analysed with a megamatrix approach, combining patch dynamics of the nest-mounds with patch-specific population dynamics. Contributions of different phases and patch types to growth rate were estimated by elasticity analysis. Results: Nest-mounds differed in the percentage of bare soil. Increasing moss cover significantly reduced germination and seed production of all studied annuals and decreased their population growth rates (lambda). Although successional processes dominated over ant disturbance, populations of all species could survive well (lambda >> 1) in the grassland according to the 2000-2001 megamatrix dynamics. Based on the dynamics from the following period, two species would not survive in a long-term perspective due to random environmental variation. Whereas the A-A transition (adult plants originating from adults of the previous year) had the highest elasticity under open conditions and 'good period' demography, the importance of persistent seeds increased under reverse conditions. This, however, differed among species. Conclusions: Ant-disturbance was shown to be critical for the population survival of five annual species in the studied grassland. The fate of the annual populations in the grassland system also depends on random environmental variation, which may override the effect of ant activity.},

   abstract = {Emergence of seedlings of four alvar grassland species (Arenaria serpyllifolia, Festuca ovina, Filipendula 6ulgaris and Veronica spicata) in bryophyte and lichen carpets was analysed in a series of greenhouse experiments. The aspects investigated were: the influence of thickness of moss mats, both in dry and moist conditions, the effects of thick Cladonia spp. clumps, and of living vs dead moss shoots and lichen podetia. Overall, Festuca seedlings emerged best whereas the small-seeded species, Arenaria and Veronica, had the lowest emergence. Moisture had a significant effect only on the emergence of Festuca seedlings, which emerged better in the dry treatment than in the moist. A thick moss cover negatively affected seedling emergence of Arenaria and Veronica but did not affect the emergence of Festuca. Filipendula showed lower seedling emergence in both thick and thin moss than on bare soil only in the dry treatment, whereas in the moist treatment emergence did not differ among the three substrates. Arenaria seedlings emerged less in thick and thin moss than on bare soil in the dry treatment, whereas in the moist treatment emergence in the thin moss was not different from bare soil. Thus, in relatively dry environments even a thin moss cover may inhibit rather than facilitate seedling emergence. The lichen clumps inhibited only the emergence of the forbs. Both living moss shoots and lichen podetia inhibited emergence of Veronica seedlings but did not affect Festuca. In contrast, emergence in the presence of dead mosses and lichens did not differ from emergence in their absence for both species. Hence, inhibition of seedling emergence by bryophytes and lichens of at least some vascular plant species may be mediated by some biotic factor. However, the effect of differences in substrate properties on germination cannot be excluded},

   abstract = {The moss Campylopus introflexus is a Southern Hemisphere species in the process of expanding its distributional range. It was first found in Europe in 1941. 2. Some of the potential impacts of the invasion of C. introflexus into moorland habitats are investigated. In particular, the effects that the moss carpets may have on germination and subsequent growth of Calluna vulgaris are assessed. 3. A glasshouse experiment contrasted both the amount of germination of Calluna seeds and the performance of the seedlings on moss carpets and on bare ground. The effect of moisture availability was analysed, comparing normal daily watering with continuous water supply at the base of the pots. A significant depressive effect (60% reduction) of the moss carpet on the amount of germination was observed, irrespective of the form of water supply. However, seedlings grew higher and produced more flowers when growing on moss carpets. 4. Two experiments tested for the possibility of an allelopathic interaction. In one experiment seeds of Calluna were treated with a solution obtained from soaking moss fragments in deionized water. In the other the seeds were placed together with moss shoots. Neither experiment indicated allelopathic effects. 5. The results of glasshouse experiments suggested that there was no definite evidence that C. introflexus can suppress Calluna re-establishment following fire. However, under field conditions, the germination rate of heather on moss carpets can be expected to be much lower and its growth rate will be reduced by grazing. These conditions will make it more difficult for the heather to compensate for the loss in recruitment. 6. It is hypothesized that the dynamics of the moss carpet itself may play an important part in the competitive success of C. introflexus.},

   abstract = {Establishment of plants through seeds is often constrained by the quality of microsites, which is in part controlled by the nature and amount of ground cover. The latter consists of living shoots of vascular plants or bryophytes and/or the dead remains of the dominant species. In the present article, we report the results of a controlled pot experiment with five species characteristic of floodplain grasslands. We manipulated the amounts of grass litter and/or mosses to study (1) differences between ground cover types with respect to their effects on microenvironment and seedling emergence and (2) how these effects interact with seed size and seed sowing position. Increasing amounts of both cover types led to increasing soil humidity, whereas temperature amplitude and illumination were decreased. However, since grass litter decomposed much faster than bryophytes, light conditions for germination under grass litter improved considerably with time. Although seedling emergence varied significantly between species, ground cover types and cover amounts, seed position alone explained about 50% of the variation in the data set. Additionally, we found an important interaction between seed size, seed position and cover type: large-seeded species showed a fitness advantage when seeds were situated beneath a cover, irrespective of cover type, which disappeared when seeds were shed on top of a cover layer. We suggest that this interaction may be ecologically and evolutionarily relevant because it may lead to changes in species composition and diversity of plant communities as a consequence of changes in the amount and type of ground cover.},

   abstract = {At the core of plant regeneration, temperature and water supply are   critical drivers for seed dormancy (initiation, break) and germination.   Hence, global climate change is altering these environmental cues and   will preclude, delay, or enhance regeneration from seeds, as already   documented in some cases. Along with compromised seedling emergence and   vigour, shifts in germination phenology will influence population   dynamics, and thus, species composition and diversity of communities.   Altered seed maturation (including consequences for dispersal) and seed   mass will have ramifications on life history traits of plants. Predicted   changes in temperature and precipitation, and thus in soil moisture,   will affect many components of seed persistence in soil, e.g. seed   longevity, dormancy release and germination, and soil pathogen activity.   More/less equitable climate will alter geographic distribution for   species, but restricted migratory capacity in some will greatly limit   their response. Seed traits for weedy species could evolve relatively   quickly to keep pace with climate change enhancing their negative   environmental and economic impact. Thus, increased research in   understudied ecosystems, on key issues related to seed ecology, and on   evolution of seed traits in nonweedy species is needed to more fully   comprehend and plan for plant responses to global warming.},

   abstract = {When a plant invests in construction of a leaf, the revenue-stream that accrues is shaped by three variables: first, the light-capture area per milligram dry mass invested, analogous to a potential rate of return on investment; second, the longevity of the leaf, analogous to the expected duration of the revenue stream; and third, a time-discount rate, quantifying the fact that light-capture area deployed in the immediate future is more valuable to the plant than the same area deployed at some later time. Recent comparative data make it possible to quantify the cross-species trade-off between the first variable and the second variable. Here we develop an approach through which the consequences of the third variable, the time-discount rate, can be related to the trade-off between the first variable and the second variable. The approach involves an equal-benefit set, the cross-species equivalent of a fitness set. A wide spread of strategies is actually observed to coexist in vegetation, from low to high light capture area per gram and, correspondingly, from high to low leaf longevity. The coexistence suggests that the different observed strategies do not have a clear-cut advantage over the other. The equal-benefit set can be used to investigate what levels of time discount would make it the case that neither the highest-longevity nor the highest light-capture area per milligram strategies would have a clear advantage over the other, with regard to the time-discounted value of the revenue stream generated per milligram invested in leaf.},

L'objectif de ma thèse est de mettre en évidence le rôle prépondérant des interactions complexes (impliquant plus de deux compartiments biotiques) dans la dynamique forestière et plus particulièrement dans la dynamique de régénération des ligneux d'intérêt sylvicole tel que le chêne sessile. Les résultats soulignent l'importance de prendre en compte : (i) l'effet des cervidés sur les patrons de réponses des interactions entre plantes le long des gradients de ressources, (ii) les interactions indirectes et notamment la facilitation indirecte, (iii) des paramètres démographiques différents en relation avec la phénologie des espèces en présence, (iv) la séparation des mécanismes sous-jacents à une interaction écologique multiple via un suivi des conditions environnementales. Ainsi, ma thèse appuie l'idée que les gestions se focalisant sur une unique pression et ignorant les autres pressions ne sont pas capables de maintenir des populations d'espèces cibles car elles ne tiennent pas compte des interactions multiples. Ceci souligne l'importance d'utiliser des stratégies complémentaires pour permettre la pérennité des écosystèmes forestiers et notamment une régénération suffisante dans le cadre des changements globaux que sont le changement climatique et la surabondance de cervidés.},

   abstract = {In most previous studies of habitat selection, the use of a given habitat type is assumed to be directly proportional to its availability. However, the use and (or) the selection of a given habitat may be conditional on the availability of that habitat. We aim here to (i) identify the environmental variables involved in habitat selection, (ii) identify classes of individuals with similar patterns of habitat selection, and (iii) assess whether habitat use changes with changing availability of habitat types, within monthly home ranges of female western roe deer (Capreolus capreolus (L., 1758)). We found that some females adjust their habitat use according to the distribution of resources within habitats. Females with similar home ranges in terms of resource quantity and quality showed similar patterns of habitat selection. Differences in habitat use between 2 years with contrasting resource availability showed that temporal changes of environmental conditions influenced the pattern of habitat selection by female roe deer. Habitat selection also differed between periods of the life cycle likely because of contrasted energy requirements. This study shows that the relationship between habitat use by herbivores and habitat availability is nonproportional, and that the availability of resources influences use mostly at intermediate values.},

   abstract = {1. During the last decade the use of natural regeneration has become an accepted method of restocking British woodlands after harvesting. However, in many broadleaved woodlands there are insufficient numbers of established tree seedlings of adequate size to ensure that restocking is successful. This lack of seedlings may be related to a number of factors, including competition from the ground flora and browsing by deer. 2. The numbers of deer ( Capreolus capreolus , Cervus elaphus and Dama dama ) are rising throughout Britain and population densities frequently exceed those known to have a significant impact on broadleaved trees. This experiment, which took place at four sites over a 5-year period, studied the effects of competition from the ground flora and severe, simulated, browsing by deer during summer, on the growth and mortality of naturally occurring Acer pseudoplatanus , Fraxinus excelsior , Fagus sylvatica and Quercus robur seedlings. 3. The seedlings were initially 30–40 cm tall with stem diameters of 2·6–6·2 mm. Competition from the ground flora was removed by maintaining circular areas, 1 m in diameter, free of vegetation using a general herbicide. Browsing was simulated by clipping new shoots that were longer than 1 cm in June and August. 4. The control of the ground flora had little effect on the growth and survival of seedling trees. 5. In general, the number of tree seedlings producing sufficient growth to receive the simulated browsing treatment decreased with time, but for those seedlings that were clipped there were no consistent trends in either numbers or weights of shoots removed. Unclipped seedlings continued to grow. The height and stem diameter increments varied with species and site, but after 5 years unclipped plants were 50–200% taller with stem diameters 20–130% greater than at the start of the experiment. 6. The mortality of unclipped seedlings was low and 80% or more survived. Clipping significantly reduced the survival of Fraxinus excelsior and A. pseudoplatanus , but Q. robur and Fagus sylvatica were unaffected. On an annual basis, there was no relationship between mortality and accumulated number or dry weight of shoots clipped, initial stem diameter or height, and whether or not the seedling was under the overstorey canopy. 7. The results from this study indicate that established seedlings of A. pseudoplatanus , Fraxinus excelsior , Fagus sylvatica and Q. robur that are > 30 cm tall can survive several years of severe browsing under the shade provided by overstorey canopy covers of 50% or more. This suggests that management should aim to improve survival during the first 1–2 years of growth. This may be achieved by exclusion of animals by fencing, protection of individual seedlings using tree shelters, or culling to control herbivore numbers.},

   abstract = {Phytochemical coevolution theory posits that specialist herbivores will be less sensitive than generalists to the defensive compounds of their host. On the other hand, both types of herbivores should allegedly be similarly sensitive to 'quantitative' defences, such as tannin compounds. In this paper, we critically examine the biological effects of two types of tannins: vescalagin (a quantitatively dominant hydrolysable tannin of Quercus robur), and a mix of condensed tannins. In a phylogenetically controlled design, we compare the response of two specialist moth species (Dichonia aprilina and Catocala sponsa) and two generalist species (Acronicta psi and Amphipyra pyramidea) to four artificial diets: a control diet, a diet with 50 mg g22121 vescalagin, a diet with 15 mg/g condensed tannins, and a diet with both 50 mg g22121 vescalagin and 15 mg g22121 condensed tannins. Overall, we find drastic effects of vescalagin and pronounced differences in the responses of generalist and specialist herbivores, but no detectable effects of condensed tannins, and no interaction between the two types of compounds. More specifically, vescalagin reduced the growth of generalist species to one-half of control levels over 72 h. The compound served as a strong feeding deterrent to generalists, reducing ingestion rates by two-thirds. Vescalagin also reduced the metabolic and growth efficiency of generalist species to between 16% and 56% of control levels 2013 effects which were lacking or even reversed in specialist species. These patterns suggest that vescalagin forms an important part of the oak's defence against herbivores, and that specialist species have adapted to deal with such substances. In terms of biological effects, condensed tannins seem much less important. Given a quantitative dominance of hydrolysable tannins over condensed tannins in oak leaves, and a seasonal decline in overall tannin levels, these findings contradict the previous notion that widespread spring feeding among oak herbivores could be attributed to tannins.},

   abstract = {Accurate estimates of bite mass and variations in the short-term intake rate of grazing herbivores has been historically considered as a fundamental methodological difficulty, a difficulty that increases with the complexity of the feeding environment. Improving these methodologies will help understand foraging behaviours in natural grazing conditions, where habitat structure and interactionsamongdifferent forages influence feeding decisions and patterns. During the past 30 years, we have been developing the ‘continuous bite-monitoring’ method, an observational method that allows continuous assessment of foraging behaviours, including bite mass, instantaneous intake rate and food selection, in simple to complex feeding environments. The centrepiece of the method is a ‘bite-coding grid’ where bites are categorised by structural attributes of the forage to reflect differences in bite masses. Over the years, we have been using this method with goats, sheep, llamas and cattle across a range of different habitats. After reviewing the development of the method, we detail its planning and execution in the field. We illustrate the method with a study from southern Brazilian native Pampa grassland, showing how changes in the forages consumed by heifers strongly affect short-term intake rate during meals. Finally, we emphasise the importance of studying animals grazing in their natural environments to first identify the relevant processes that can later be tested in controlled experiments.},

   abstract = {Extreme climatic events, such as hurricanes, may profoundly affect herbivore population dynamics and habitat use by returning tracts of mature forest to early seral stages where food and cover resources rapidly develop. Modifications of habitat use by roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) following hurricane Lothar have been demonstrated in a French forest, and it has been suggested that the combination of a reduction in hunting due to hunters' inability to access the areas and an improvement in habitat characteristics in clearings resulted in Lothar having a positive effect on roe deer population dynamics. Here, we studied the winter diet of red deer (Cervus elaphus) and roe deer before and after hurricane Lothar in a heavily damaged forest, assuming that the hurricane, by creating numerous clearings in which food availability for herbivores increased rapidly, allowed deer to specialize on preferred plant species that benefited from habitat modifications, particularly bramble and grasses. According to their feeding types and ecology, we expected that the increase in the availability of grasses and bramble after the hurricane would result in an increase in the proportions of these plants in the diet of red deer and an increase in the proportion of bramble in the diet of roe deer. Analysis of stomach contents revealed that consumption of grasses by red deer almost doubled following the hurricane, but no effect on bramble consumption by either deer species could be detected. Our study also revealed a significant annual variation in bramble consumption, which suggests that its availability as a food resource for deer varies from year to year, and this may have masked the hurricane effect. We then discuss the role of disturbances in improving habitat for forest ungulates, and the role of key alternative food resource in helping forest managers to find solutions for mitigating ungulate impact on tree regeneration. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {We describe food selection by roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in relation to the food quality of the plants available (the concentrations of fibres, sugars, crude protein, and of phenolics and terpenes). Seven tame roe deer feeding in an oak-beech woodland edge used the majority (80-94%) of the plant species available: they were therefore generalist feeders. However, they preferred only a small number of plant species in the different seasons: ivy (Hedera helix) in winter and autumn, dogwood (Cornus spp.) in summer, hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), hawthorn (Crataegus spp.) and bluebells (Hyacinthoides non-scripta) in spring. No preference or avoidance could be demonstrated for 74-85% of the available species, but 7-12 species were avoided according to the season. Though the avoided species were sometimes common, they never comprised an important part of the diet. In contrast, the preferred species made up only 4-13% of the available green matter but composed a large part of the diet (22-49%). Although generalists, the roe deer were therefore also highly selective feeders. The use of the different plant species was influenced by their availability, but to a different extent in the different seasons. Use of the plant species correlated negatively with the fibre content, as predicted from the digestive morphology of this concentrate selector. Preference/avoidance was related to the concentrations of soluble sugars, but not the crude protein content. Contrary to expectation, the roe deer preferred plants with a high concentration of protein-binding phenolics, suggesting that this deer has specific mechanisms for de-activating these compounds. Among the nutritional consequences of the feeding strategy of roe were a 17-35% higher soluble sugar content of the diet compared with the available green plant tissues, and an even greater increase in the phenolics. The crude protein contents and the dry matter digestibility of the diets tended to be slightly higher, and the fibre contents were lower, than those of the available green plant tissues.},

   abstract = {The development of feeding behaviour in European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) was studied using nine fawns, from birth to 1.5 months. They were offered individually, seven plant species in random order, one at a time, and their feeding behaviour recorded. The results were compared to the behaviour of eight adults offered the same plants, which were chosen to cover the whole range from preferred to strongly avoided plants. Fawns displayed selectivity towards the different plants from their first contact, and they appeared to respond initially to buccal, but not olfactory, stimuli. Thereafter consumption of the two preferred species increased, while use of the others remained at a very low level. For the two plant types most strongly avoided (and perhaps the most toxic), learning allowed the deer to distinguish and avoid the plants using olfactory (and perhaps also visual) stimuli. For the other three species, fawns continued to ingest small quantities which may have allowed them to learn to avoid these plants, using the association between taste and negative post-ingestive consequences. This process may also have been involved in the increases in the consumption of the two preferred species. The animals were able to discriminate to almost the same extent as adults by the time they were about I month old. These results underline the importance of learning, and identify some of the stimuli involved in the development and maintenance of the highly selective and flexible feeding behaviour of this herbivore.},

   abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: It is generally thought that herbivore pressure is higher at lower elevations where climate is warmer and less seasonal, and that this has led to higher levels of plant defense investment at low elevations. However, the generality of this expectation has been called into question by recent studies. METHODS: We tested for altitudinal gradients in insect leaf damage, plant defenses (phenolic compounds), and nutritional traits (phosphorus and nitrogen) in leaves of the long-lived tree Quercus robur, and further investigated the abiotic factors associated with such gradients. We sampled 20 populations of Q. robur distributed along an altitudinal gradient spanning 35–869 m above sea level, which covered most of the altitudinal range of this species and varied substantially in abiotic conditions, plant traits, and herbivory. KEY RESULTS: Univariate regressions showed that leaf herbivory, phenolics, and phosphorus increased toward higher elevations, whereas leaf nitrogen did not vary with altitude. Multiple regression analyses indicated that temperature was the single most important factor associated with herbivory and appears to be strongly associated with altitudinal variation in damage. Leaf phenolics were also correlated with herbivory, but in a manner that suggests these chemical defenses do not underlie altitudinal variation in damage. In addition, we found that variation in leaf traits (phenolics and nutrients) was in turn associated with both climatic and soil variables. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these findings suggest that altitudinal gradients in herbivory and defenses in Q. robur are uncoupled and that elevational variation in herbivory and plant traits responds mainly to abiotic factors.},

Cytogenetically, uncertainties exist on species basic number, ploidy level, and sex chromosomes. In this study, detailed cytogenetic measurements were carried out on six Romanian ecotypes belonging to Hippophae rhamnoides L. ssp. carpatica Rousi, in order to establish the features and the symmetry degree of karyotypes, to evidence the sex chromosomes, and to construct the idiogram. The ecotypes have 2n = 24 metacentric and submetacentric chromosomes. An intraspecific variation exists concerning the proportion of these two morpho-types. The karyotypes have similar symmetry patterns (R = 2.57-2.89; \{TF%\} = 38.54-42.70; \{AsI%\} = 57.99-61.41; A(1) = 0.27-0.35; A(2) = 0.26-0.36) and belong to \{1B\} and \{2B\} classes, being relatively high symmetric.

Existing indices of morphological development are unsuitable for use with plants having a semideterminate, recurrently flushing pattern of growth as displayed by Quercus seedlings. We propose the following morphological index (QMI) to define the stages of Quercus seedling ontogeny: (1) radicle emergence; (2) epicotyl emergence from the soil; and (for each flush) (3) termination of elongation of the second internode, which corresponds with the period of most rapid stem elongation; (4) completion of elongation by all internodes, which corresponds with the period of most rapid leaf elongation; and (5) completion of elongation of the last leaf but one, which usually precedes closely the pause between one growth flush and another. The relationship between QMI and net photosynthesis by individual leaves of Quercus rubra L. seedlings was determined. Net photosynthesis increased with QMI during a flush, but at a particular QMI stage, generally decreased from one flush to the next.},

   abstract = {Stability in population dynamics is an emergent property of the interaction between direct and delayed density dependence, the strengths of which vary with environmental covariates. Analysis of variation across populations in the strength of direct and delayed density dependence can reveal variation in stability properties of populations at the species level. We examined the stability properties of 22 elk/red deer populations in a two-stage analysis. First, we estimated direct and delayed density dependence applying an AR(2) model in a Bayesian hierarchical framework. Second, we plotted the coefficients of direct and delayed density dependence in the Royama parameter plane. We then used a hierarchical approach to test the significance of environmental covariates of direct and delayed density dependence. Three populations exhibited highly stable and convergent dynamics with strong direct, and weak delayed, density dependence. The remaining 19 populations exhibited more complex dynamics characterized by multi-annual fluctuations. Most (15 of 19) of these exhibited a combination of weak to moderate direct and delayed density dependence. Best-fit models included environmental covariates in 17 populations (77% of the total). Of these, interannual variation in growing-season primary productivity and interannual variation in winter temperature were the most common, performing as the best-fit covariate in six and five populations, respectively. Interannual variation in growing-season primary productivity was associated with the weakest combination of direct and delayed density dependence, while interannual variation in winter temperature was associated with the strongest combination of direct and delayed density dependence. These results accord with a classic theoretical prediction that environmental variability should weaken population stability. They furthermore suggest that two forms of environmental variability, one related to forage resources and the other related to abiotic conditions, both reduce stability, but in opposing fashion: one through weakened direct density dependence and the other through strengthened delayed density dependence. Importantly, however, no single abiotic or biotic environmental factor emerged as generally predictive of the strengths of direct or delayed density dependence, nor of the stability properties emerging from their interaction. Our results emphasize the challenges inherent to ascribing primacy to drivers of such parameters at the species level and distribution scale.},

   abstract = {Research on climate change impacts has focused on projecting changes in the geographic ranges of species, with less emphasis on the vital rates giving rise to species distributions. Managing ungulate populations under future climate change will require an understanding of how their vital rates are affected by direct climatic effects and the indirect climatic and non-climatic effects that are often overlooked by climate impact studies. We used generalized linear models and capture-mark-recapture models to assess the influence of a variety of direct climatic, indirect climatic, and non-climatic predictors on the survival of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) at 2 sites in Sweden. The models indicated that although direct climatic effects (e.g., precipitation) explained some variation in survival, indirect climatic effects (e.g., an index of vegetation production), and non-climatic effects (hunting by lynx [Lynx lynx] and humans) had greater explanatory power. Climate change is likely to increase vegetation productivity in northern Europe, and, coupled with the positive effects of vegetation productivity on roe deer survival, might lead to population increases in the future. Survival was negatively affected by lynx presence where these predators occur and by human harvest in the site that lacked predators. In the future, managers might find that a combination of increased harvest and predation by recovering carnivore populations may be necessary to mitigate climate-induced increases in roe deer survival. Considering vegetation availability and predation effects is likely to improve predictions of ungulate population responses to variation in climate and, therefore, inform management under future climate change.},

   abstract = {The “niche variation hypothesis” (NVH) predicts that populations with wider niches should display higher among-individual variability. This prediction originally stated at the intra-specific level may be extended to the inter-specific level: individuals of generalist species may differ to a greater extent than individuals of a specialist species. We tested the NVH at intra- and inter-specific levels based on a large diet database of three large herbivore feces collected in the field and analyzed using DNA metabarcoding. The three herbivores (roe deer Capreolus capreolus, chamois Rupicapra rupicapra and mouflon Ovis musimon) are highly contrasted in terms of sociality (solitary to highly gregarious) and diet. The NVH at the intraspecific level was tested by relating, for the same population, diet breadth and inter-individual variation across the four seasons. Compared to null models, our data supported the NVH both at the intra- and inter-specific levels. Inter-individual variation of the diet of solitary species was not larger than in social species, although social individuals feed together and could therefore have more similar diets. Hence, the NVH better explained diet breadth than other factors such as sociality. The expansion of the population niche of the three species was driven by resource availability, and achieved by an increase in inter-individual variation, and the level of inter-individual variability was larger in the generalist species (mouflon) than in the specialist one (roe deer). This mechanism at the base of the NVH appears at play at different levels of biological organization, from populations to communities.},

The spatial pattern and scale of polyphenol concentration in natural populations are practically unknown, despite multiple evidence that resources influencing leaf phenolics (such as light or nutrient availability) show spatial dependence at the scale of meters to tens of meters. By using geostatistical methods, we evaluated the spatial variability in polyphenol concentration in green and senescent leaves in a pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) population of 125 individuals. The spatial pattern of light and nutrient availability for plants was also evaluated. Leaf polyphenols were more variable than other leaf properties, and green polyphenols were significantly correlated with radiation, leaf mass per unit area and leaf N concentration. Both green and senescent leaf polyphenol concentration showed spatial dependence at distances below 6 to 10 m, with structural (spatial) variance explaining between 50 and 80% of the total variance. The variance not explained by space was assumed to be due to individual genotypic variability. Stochastic maps of leaf phenolics in the area showed that the probability of finding high phenolics level was not random. These findings may be important to understand the spatial heterogeneity of plant-herbivore interactions, leaf litter decomposition and mineralization rate},

   abstract = {Traditional approaches to conservation often focus on plant species composition. In contrast, trait-based approaches highlight the role plant species play in ecosystem function, with a focus on functional diversity and its importance for ecosystem resilience. Here we utilise a plant-trait approach to explore the association between livestock grazing intensity and plant functional diversity in Atlantic oak woodlands, a conservation priority habitat. In two historically un-grazed woodlands (subject to periods of light sheep grazing in winter) paired with two grazed woodlands (intensively grazed by sheep or feral goats), in north-west Wales, UK, field plant-trait data were recorded in three (30 × 4 m) plots per woodland for trees, saplings and understory plants. For trees and saplings, plant-trait data from the field (specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC)) were combined with plant tolerance indices from the scientific literature (shade, drought and water-logging tolerance) and used to calculate community weighted means (CWM) and functional diversity for plot-level communities. Three plant traits (LDMC, mean foliage height and growth form) and two Ellenberg indices (light and moisture) were combined to calculate CWM and functional diversity for understory plant communities. Tree and sapling communities from grazed woodlands were characterised by response traits associated with grazing avoidance strategies (high LDMC, low SLA), and higher shade – and drought-tolerance scores but lower water-logging-tolerance scores than in un-grazed woodlands. Tree and sapling communities in the un-grazed woodlands had greater seedling establishment, sapling recruitment and functional diversity than in the grazed woodlands. Plant-trait values and functional diversity did not differ with grazing intensity for understory plants. Land managers are increasingly being asked to manage semi-natural habitats for ‘resilience to future events’ such as droughts or floods. Here we demonstrate how a plant-trait approach, including assessment of community-level tolerance indices, allows us to infer potential associations between grazing management, functional diversity and ecosystem resilience.},

   abstract = {Carbon assimilated during photosynthesis is allocated to basic needs, such as growth, defense, and storage of nutrients. The aim of this study was to explore potential relationships between carbon allocation and light conditions during growth, including shade tolerance of species. We studied species that represent light-demanding (Sorbus aucuparia, Betula pendula), intermediate (Carpinus betulus, Quercus robur), and shade-tolerant (Acer platanoides, Fagus sylvatica) trees. We exposed seedlings to two light treatments (full sunlight and shade), and explored how these conditions affect plant growth and biomass allocation, as well as the levels of phenolic compounds, nonstructural carbohydrates, carbon, and nitrogen. We hypothesized that light-demanding species invest less carbon in chemical defenses against pathogens and/or herbivores compared to shade-tolerant species. On the other hand, light-demanding species showed the greater part of assimilated carbon allocate to growth processes. As a result, the stem diameter above the root collar, the mass of leaves, stems, coarse, and fine roots were larger under full-sunlight conditions in all species, except for greater height of A. platanoides and Q. robur under shade conditions. Leaves from full light were characterized by lower nitrogen content, higher carbon and phenolic contents, and a higher carbon/nitrogen ratio compared with leaves from seedlings grown in shade. In the case of shade-tolerant species, a trade-off mechanism can be proposed that such species restrict their usual allocation of carbon to defense and radial growth, while instead of investing it in increasing their heights and storage capacities. According to the light-demanding species, it was not possible to identify a trade-off mechanism and how carbon allocation is restricted upon exposure to shade conditions, except for the reduced allocation to the root mass.},

   abstract = {Abstract Question Functional plant traits often express consistent changes along ecological gradients and, hence, are often used as indicators of environmental change (e.g. nutrient availability, temperature changes). Besides being driven by edaphic conditions, functional plant composition is filtered by herbivory, and traits responsive to nutrient availability often coincide with those related to palatability or resistance to browsing. We hypothesized that herbivory may distort the ways in which traits are expressed along environmental gradients. Location Bia?owie?a National Park, Poland. Methods We used a long?term controlled, exclosure experiment in the Bia?owie?a National Park to study tree functional trait expression and plant indicator values, with and without large ungulate browsing, along a natural soil fertility gradient. Results Browsing largely reduced the functional diversity of regenerating trees, indicated by multivariate analysis and Rao's Quadratic Entropy (RQE), and altered how several traits change with increasing fertility. Browsing led to an increase in specific leaf area (SLA) on poorer sites. RQE showed a hump?backed trend along the fertility gradient, indicating the largest functional diversity at intermediate fertility. However, this pattern was not affected by browsing. Unlike the morphological tree traits, trends of light and N plant indicator values along the gradient were unaffected by browsing. Conclusions These results highlight how the expression of plant traits resulting from one driver (soil fertility) can be modified by another driver (herbivory,) and stress the importance of taking herbivory into account when using plant traits as indicators of large?scale processes (e.g. climate change). Furthermore, the results suggest that plant indicator values may be more robust towards these effects, while compiled indices such as RQE could mask considerable functional turnover. Several traits (e.g. SLA) are strongly connected to nutrient cycling. The development, driven by browsing, towards higher SLA on poorer sites may thus cause a positive feedback effect on site fertility that drives an increase in nutrient availability. This may in turn have implications for ecosystem functionality. Hence, the large reduction in functional diversity revealed at the scale of this study may in the long term have implications on multiple ecosystem processes.},

   abstract = {* Large mammalian herbivores (LMH) strongly shape the composition and architecture of plant communities. A growing literature shows that negative direct effects of LMH on vegetation frequently propagate to suppress the abundance of smaller consumers. Indirect effects of LMH on the behaviour of these consumers, however, have received comparatively little attention despite their potential ecological significance.


* We sought to understand (i) how LMH indirectly shape small-mammal habitat use by altering the density and distribution of understorey plants; (ii) how these effects vary with climatic context (here, seasonality in rainfall); and (iii) the extent to which behavioural responses of small mammals are contingent upon small-mammal density.


* We tested the effects of a diverse LMH community on small-mammal habitat use using 4 years of spatially explicit small-mammal trapping and vegetation data from the UHURU Experiment, a replicated set of LMH exclosures in semi-arid Kenyan savanna.


* Small-mammal habitat use was positively associated with tree density and negatively associated with bare (unvegetated) patches in all plots and seasons. In the presence of LMH, and especially during the dry season, small mammals consistently selected tree cover and avoided bare patches. In contrast, when LMH were excluded, small mammals were weakly associated with tree cover and did not avoid bare patches as strongly. These behavioural responses of small mammals were largely unaffected by changes in small-mammal density associated with LMH exclusion.


* Our results show that LMH indirectly affect small-mammal behaviour, and that these effects are influenced by climate and can arise via density-independent mechanisms. This raises the possibility that anthropogenic LMH declines might interact with changing patterns of rainfall to alter small-mammal distribution and behaviour, independent of numerical responses by small mammals to these perturbations. For example, increased rainfall in East Africa (as predicted in many recent climate-model simulations) may relax constraints on small-mammal distribution where LMH are rare or absent, whereas increased aridity and/or drought frequency may tighten them.},

   abstract = {Question: A set of easily-measured ('soft') plant traits has been identified as potentially useful predictors of ecosystem functioning in previous studies. Here we aimed to discover whether the screening techniques remain operational in widely contrasted circumstances, to test for the existence of axes of variation in the particular sets of traits, and to test for their links with 'harder' traits of proven importance to ecosystem functioning. Location: central-western Argentina, central England, northern upland Iran, and north-eastern Spain. Recurrent patterns of ecological specialization: Through ordination of a matrix of 640 vascular plant taxa by 12 standardized traits, we detected similar patterns of specialization in the four floras. The first PCA axis was identified as an axis of resource capture, usage and release. PCA axis 2 appeared to be a size-related axis. Individual PCA for each country showed that the same traits remained valuable as predictors of resource capture and utilization in all of them, despite their major differences in climate, biogeography and land-use. The results were not significantly driven by particular taxa: the main traits determining PCA axis 1 were very similar in eudicotyledons and monocotyledons and Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Poaceae. Links between recurrent suites of 'soft' traits and 'hard' traits: The validity of PCA axis 1 as a key predictor of resource capture and utilization was tested by comparisons between this axis and values of more rigorously established predictors ('hard' traits) for the floras of Argentina and England. PCA axis 1 was correlated with variation in relative growth rate, leaf nitrogen content, and litter decomposition rate. It also coincided with palatability to model generalist herbivores. Therefore, location on PCA axis 1 can be linked to major ecosystem processes in those habitats where the plants are dominant. Conclusion: We confirm the existence at the global scale of a major axis of evolutionary specialization, previously recognised in several local floras. This axis reflects a fundamental trade-off between rapid acquisition of resources and conservation of resources within well-protected tissues. These major trends of specialization were maintained across different environmental situations (including differences in the proximate causes of low productivity, i.e. drought or mineral nutrient deficiency). The trends were also consistent across floras and major phylogenetic groups, and were linked with traits directly relevant to ecosystem processes.},

   abstract = {Marked impacts of climate change on biodiversity have frequently been demonstrated, including temperature-related shifts in phenology and life-history traits. One potential major impact of climate change is the modification of synchronization between the phenology of different trophic levels. High phenotypic plasticity in laying date has allowed many bird species to track the increasingly early springs resulting from recent environmental change, but although changes in the timing of reproduction have been well studied in birds, these questions have only recently been addressed in mammals. To track peak resource availability, large herbivores like roe deer, with a widespread distribution across Europe, should also modify their life-history schedule in response to changes in vegetation phenology over time. In this study, we analysed the influence of climate change on the timing of roe deer births and the consequences for population demography and individual fitness. Our study provides a rare quantification of the demographic costs associated with the failure of a species to modify its phenology in response to a changing world. Given these fitness costs, the lack of response of roe deer birth dates to match the increasingly earlier onset of spring is in stark contrast with the marked phenotypic responses to climate change reported in many other mammals. We suggest that the lack of phenotypic plasticity in birth timing in roe deer is linked to its inability to track environmental cues of variation in resource availability for the timing of parturition.},

Investigating the relationship between body condition, age, sex, diet quality and diet composition is therefore relevant to increase understanding of herbivores' ecosystem function and to inform management. In this study, we focused on red deer, Cervus elaphus, in a fenced nature reserve in Denmark, where the deer are managed as ecosystem engineers to contribute to biodiversity conservation. We measured body mass and body size of 91 culled red deer, and determined diet composition using DNA metabarcoding and diet quality using fecal nitrogen on 246 fecal samples. We found that body condition was predicted by age and diet composition, but not diet quality. We also found that individuals of different body condition had different diets, i.e., the fecal samples of red deer in poorer body condition contained significantly more Ericaceae sequences than red deer in good body condition. This may imply that certain functions of red deer in ecosystems, such as regeneration of heather by grazing, may depend on variation in body condition within the population. Our findings call for the need to consider the consequences of management practices, including culling or supplemental feeding, on the outcomes of habitat restoration, and more broadly underline the importance of preserving the overall breath of herbivore ecosystem functions for effective biodiversity conservation.},

   abstract = {The understanding of population density and weather effects is fundamental for evaluating the population dynamics of ungulates. However, studies focusing on temporal variations in diet composition are limited. We investigated the effects of population density and snow depth on variation in the winter diet composition of 2 contrasting sika deer (Cervus nippon) populations in Oku-Nikko and Ashio, Tochigi Prefecture, central Japan by monitoring diet composition for ≥15 years. The main food in Oku-Nikko was dwarf bamboo (Sasa nipponica), which has a high crude protein content. This plant sometimes had low availability because of the combination of snow accumulation and reduced culm height associated with chronic grazing. The main food in Ashio was Japanese pampas grass (Miscanthus sinensis), which has a low crude protein content, but its availability was high because of high culm height and little snow accumulation. In Oku-Nikko, snow accumulation and high deer density negatively affected the proportion of dwarf bamboo found in rumen contents, with the most significant effect found in calves. In Ashio, Japanese pampas grass composed a relatively high and constant proportion of the rumen contents when snow accumulation was ≤50 cm; however, it was negatively affected by snow accumulation of >50 cm. In addition, the utilization of Japanese pampas grass was reduced only when deer density was extremely high (>150 deer/km2). Our results clearly demonstrate that absolute density is not the sole factor that affects variation in the winter food selection of sika deer. The combined effects of snow depth and habitat quality, such as vegetation height, are overwhelmingly important in determining the winter diet composition of sika deer populations. © 2015 The Wildlife Society.},

   abstract = {As a result of diverse management policies, densities of red and roe deer have varied considerably for the last few decades in Europe. Their selective browsing on woody species can modify the interactions between competing species and thus change overall patterns of plant diversity in forests. However, no classification of woody species according to browsing by deer yet exists in Europe. The selectivity index, which measures the balance between availability and consumption of plant species by herbivores, could be used for such a classification. The aim of this study was, first, to rank woody species according to this selectivity index, then to test whether their rank changed when browsing pressure varied in space or time. We also explored morphological and ecological life traits (Ellenberg indicator values) that might explain differences in selectivity. In 2006, we re-sampled a network of 217 coupled floristic and browsing survey plots, which had been previously described twice (1976, 1981). The plots were located in the forest of Arc-en-Barrois (France), a large woodland area divided into a North and a South Forest which have had different histories of browsing pressure. For the three samples and the two forests, we calculated a selectivity index for 19 woody species. Dogwood (Cornus sp.) and field rose (Rosa arvensis) appeared to be the most selected species whereas beech (Fagus sylvatica), common mezereon (Daphne mezereum) and wild-service tree (Sorbus torminalis) were always avoided. The rank order of species according to their selectivity index remained stable over the three sample years and between the two forests (Spearman's rank correlations: ρ ≈ 0.8 spatially, and range from 0.3 to 0.8 temporally). This indicates that variations in browsing pressure did not strongly modify deer selectivity patterns. Selectivity was positively correlated with wood density and negatively correlated with maximum height of the species, but unrelated to other plant traits. Finally, selectivity can be seen as an intrinsic characteristic of those woody species, and could be used as an additional life trait when analyzing vegetation communities. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper the results of a 25-year study of a roe deer population, which was not subject to significant levels of culling, predation or ungulate competition are presented. Following planting with conifers (which was mostly in 1961-62), the canopy cover increased, most rapidly between 8 and 15 years after planting. Ground vegetation cover was negatively correlated with canopy cover. The deer population increased from 46 km-2 to 76 km-2 between 4 and 13 years after planting, after which it declined sharply to 34 km-2. A significant negative cross-correlation was found between conifer canopy cover and deer density with a lag of 6 years, indicating that the decline in deer numbers lagged behind the decline in browse supply. The rate of recruitment was correlated with the conifer canopy cover without any indication of a significant lag. The decline in cover of the main food plant species (bramble Rubus fruticosus), was much greater than the decline in deer density, implying that the deer were forced to change their diet and perhaps also their patterns of habitat selection in response to the change in habitat structure.},

   abstract = {Monitoring changes in the nutritional status of wild populations is crucial to understanding how species respond to natural or human-mediated variations in food availability and quality. It is a fundamental step for decision-making in wildlife management. Many studies on nutritional ecology still tend to rely on the use of single indicators. Nonetheless, nutrition has multiple interdependent facets that should be combined to better understand how organisms interact with their environment through feeding. Here, data from a large-scale cross-sectional survey conducted between 2010 and 2013 were used to examine the influence of environmental conditions and management practices on the variation of faecal nitrogen content (FN, index of dietary quality) and kidney fat index (KFI, indicator of nutritional condition) in red deer Cervus elaphus in the Mediterranean ecosystems of Iberia. Variations in the nutritional indicators in relation to sex, age, faecal fibre contents and faecal counts of lungworm larvae were also analysed. Our results showed that FN levels were statistically and positively correlated with vegetation primary productivity (P = 0.003). In contrast, faecal fibre fractions were significantly and negatively correlated with FN concentrations (P = 0.024 for hemicellulose, P < 0.0001 for cellulose and lignin). Moreover, a negative, marginally significant relationship was found between FN and the average altitude of the study areas (P = 0.055). The KFI was statistically higher in females than in males (P < 0.0001) and increased with increasing FN levels (P = 0.01). Fat stores were also statistically and positively correlated with vegetation productivity (P = 0.001) and with the amount of supplementary food provided (P = 0.04). The effect of high-quality diets on deer kidney fat deposits was gradually lower as the population density increased (P = 0.02). This result was more marked in non-food-supplemented populations. Both FN and KFI were statistically higher during the winter in relation to the autumn (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.005, respectively). This study shows that FN can be used to monitor and predict changes in the dietary quality, and the KFI in the nutritional status, in red deer in Mediterranean environments, reliably. Since both indicators showed different sensitivity to intrinsic, ecological and management determinants, this research also highlights their value and complementary use when studying populations of large wild herbivores.},

We analysed the relations of fruit production with airborne pollen, carbon and water resources and meteorological data in 48 French forests over 14 years (1994–2007). In oak, acorn production was mainly related to temperature conditions during the pollen emission period, supporting the pollen synchrony hypothesis. In beech, a temperature signal over the two previous years eclipsed the airborne pollen load. Fruit production in Quercus and Fagus was related to climate drivers, carbon inputs and airborne pollen through strongly nonlinear, genus-specific relations. Quercus and Fagus also differed as regards the secondary growth versus fructification trade-off. While negative relationships were observed between secondary growth and fruit production in beech, more productive years benefited to both secondary growth and reproductive effort in oak.},

However, understanding the impact of these changes in reproductive success and fitness remains a major challenge for ecologists. We describe here a previously unreported phenomenon: a significant increase in the reproductive effort (seed production) of temperate oaks with increasing spring temperature, observed over the last decade. In contrast, no relationship was found between seed production and precipitation. This sensitivity of seed production to temperature was confirmed by a “space-for-time” substitution based on elevation gradients. Our findings suggest that global warming may enhance oak reproductive effort in temperate ecosystems. Nevertheless, while fitness can be enhanced by higher levels of seed production, it also depends on the frequency and synchronization of mast seeding production, which may also be influenced by climate change.},

We evaluate the consequences of increasing drought on the growth of the two locally most important broadleaf tree species common beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.). Three mixed forests of beech and oak were sampled along a west-east gradient of declining precipitation. In total we used 257 ring-width samples from 133 trees to build six species and site specific chronologies. Additionally, we modelled the soil water budget for each site. We performed continuous and discontinuous (pointer year) analysis of climate-tree-growth relationships with particular emphasis on inter-annual-variations and their dependence upon climatic factors (temperature, precipitation, soil moisture) and on the stability of the obtained relationships. Results of climate-growth correlations together with pointer year analysis indicate a strong dependency of growth of both species from water availability, especially during early summer (June and July). General correlation pattern between growth and climate are similar for both species, but climate sensitivity of beech is generally higher. We identified drought as the main driver of negative growth depressions in both species. Increasing drought stress along the gradient is expressed in higher correlations to climatic variables, higher sensitivity (variance) of growth, and a higher number of negative pointer years for both species. For beech we also found a significant trend of decreasing average growth rates along the gradient. Growth superiority of beech compared to oak declines with decreasing precipitation. The relationships were generally stable throughout the 20th century. A rise of sensitivity together with a higher frequency of negative pointer years during the last decades suggests that increasing climatic variability together with rising temperatures might be influencing growth of Fagus at the more humid sites. If we substitute space by time it seems that already small changes in precipitation regime can have considerable impact, especially on the growth of beech. Other, more drought tolerant species like oak might gain competitive advantages under the projected climatic changes. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

We calculate weighted averages grouping the information by season, habitat, research method and their cross-products. The weighted averages are also used as input for a multivariate ratio analysis. Since the available food items dictate the possible diet composition we further investigate the influence of the habitat on the reported food selection. The influence of season on the diet composition is compared with the effect of the habitat, and other factors such as research method and geographical location of the study site. The review shows that there is relatively little seasonal variation in the diet composition, which is more closely correlated to the habitat than to the season.},

The model was tested statistically by analysing the dynamics of five Norwegian red deer populations between 1964 and 1993. Direct and delayed density dependence significantly influenced the development of the populations: delayed density dependence operated primarily through female density, whereas direct density dependence acted through both femals and male densities. Furthermore, population dynamics of Norwegian red deer were significantly affected by climate (as measured by the global weather phenomenon, the North Atlantic Oscillation: NAO). Warm, snowy winters (high NAO) were associated with decreased deer abungance, whereas the delayed (two-year) effect of warm, snowy winters had a positive effect on deer abundance. Our analyses are argued to have profound implications for the general understanding of climate change and terrestrial ecosystem functioning.},

Ten white-tailed deer with radiotransmitters increased their home range to incorporate acorn-producing areas during mast-fall. Consumption of acorns by deer constituted ca. 50% of foraging time during peak mast-fall; average consumption rate was 0.75 acorns/min searching. Although the number of acorns eaten by deer was correlated with mast-fall, a prolonged time was spent searching for acorns after mast-fall. Deer consumed 70% of marked acorns placed out during mast-fall, while medium-sized animals (e.g., Tamias striatus, Sciurus niger, Sciurus carolinensis) consumed 61% of acorns placed out later in autumn. We hypothesize that high densities of deer may limit populations of more mast-dependent species, particularly at low acorn-crop densities.},

Plant tissue chemistry is an important link between herbi- vores and decomposers. Plants that produce easily decomposable litter are also heavily browsed, because the same chemical properties that determine litter decay also determine digestibility. This trait links theories of food webs and nutrient cycles by posing a role of herbivores as functional switches determining both plant community composition and the array of litters returned to the soil. This role appears to be particularly strong in boreal forests, where nutrient availability is low and limits productivity and determines successional pathways, where effects of herbivores are strong and long lasting, and where the same plant traits that determine herbi- vore preference and response to browsing also determine interactions with soil nutrient availabil- ity. Such feedbacks cause the effects of herbivores on ecosystems to persist even after the herbivores are no longer present.},

In addition to exhibiting preferences for particular plant species, vertebrate herbivoresselect particular individuals of these species whilst leaving others undamaged.This pattern of diet selection may reflect differences in the chemical composition (andhence nutritional quality) between individual plants, and/or variability in the physicalconstraints on intake rate, such as plant structure.2. An experiment was conducted to test the effects of environmental manipulations onthe morphology and chemical composition of Sitka Spruce saplings, and to evaluatethe consequences for herbivory by Red Deer. Fertilizing the trees increased tree height,branch span and leader length, twig width and needle width, and decreased the concentrationsof total phenolics, condensed tannins, fibre and lignin but monoterpenecontent was not altered. Shading also reduced phenolic and tannin concentrations.3. When the fertilized and shaded trees were offered to deer in feeding trials, theprobability of a tree being visited by a deer and the biomass removed were influencedby tree morphological variables, as were the bite rate and intake rate of the deer. Morebiomass was removed from larger trees.4. Once the effects of tree morphology had been taken into account, there was noeffect of the fertilizer and shade treatments on deer browsing behaviour that could beattributed to changes in chemical composition of the trees. The relationship betweenintake rate and bite size at each tree varied between individual deer, but the functionalresponse relationship between intake rate and bite size was not influenced by thetreatments applied to the trees.5. Tree morphology may have a larger influence on deer feeding behaviour than treechemical composition.},

   abstract = {Sexual segregation, defined as the exclusive use of different areas by males and females at specified spatial and temporal scales, is common among polygynous ruminants and in cervids in particular. Underlying mechanisms for such segregation are not understood fully, and reports have included female cervids segregating into habitats of both poorer and better quality than those used by males. Furthermore, two competing hypotheses of sexual seg- regation (body-size hypothesis, reproductive-strategy hypothesis) predict different responses to changes in population density; an increase in degree of sexual segregation with increasing density in the former and a decrease in segregation in the latter. We examined patterns of sexual segregation among white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) on the Welder Wildlife Refuge in south Texas at moderate (39 deer/km2) and high (77 deer/km2) population den- sities during 1974-1977. At moderate density, females with young made greater use of chaparral-mixed grass habitat with dense cover than did males, where preferred herbaceous forage was less abundant, presumably for reasons of predator avoidance. At high density, which was a result of predator control, sexual segregation among male and females de- creased during all seasons (P < 0.05). Males that otherwise used more open habitats in- creased their use of the chaparral-mixed grass as levels of intraspecific competition in- creased. As spatial segregation between males and females decreased at the high population density, diets of both sexes shifted toward more graminoids and browse, and shifts were more pronounced among males. The result was decreased dietary overlap between sexes when measured by principal-component analysis. Measures of fat reserves suggested that although both females and males were in poorer condition at high density, females were affected to a greater extent than were males. This outcome suggested that females were not driving patterns of spatial segregation by being better able to compete with males for closely-cropped forages. Rather, predator avoidance by females with young related to the reproductive-strategy hypothesis best explained patterns we observed, and competition be- tween sexes was rejected as a cause of sexual segregation.},

   abstract = {The article reviews ruminant ecology and evolution and shows insights they offer into livestock research. The first ruminants evolved about 50 million years ago and were small (<5 kg) forest-dwelling omnivores. Today there are almost 200 living ruminant species in 6 families. Wild ruminants number about 75 million, range from about 2 to more than 800 kg, and generally prefer at least some browse in their diets. Nine species have been domesticated within the last 10,000 yr. Their combined population currently numbers 3.6 billion. In contrast to wild ruminants, domestic species naturally prefer at least some grass in their diets, are of large body weight (BW; roughly from 35 to 800 kg), and, excepting reindeer, belong to one family (Bovidae). Wild ruminants thus have a comparatively rich ecological diversity and long evolutionary history. Studying them gives a broad perspective that can augment and challenge the status quo of ruminant research and production. Allometric equations, often used in ecology, relate BW to physiological measurements from several species (typically both wild and domestic). They are chiefly used to predict or explain values of physiological parameters from BW alone. Results of one such equation suggest that artificial selection has increased peak milk energy yield by 250% over its natural level. Voluntary feed intake is proportional to BW(0.9) across wild and domestic ruminant species. This proportionality suggests that physical and metabolic factors regulate intake simultaneously, not mutually exclusively as often presumed. Studying the omasum in wild species suggests it functions primarily in particle separation and retention and only secondarily in absorption and other roles. Studies on the African Serengeti show that multiple species, when grazed together, feed such that they use grasslands more completely. They support the use of mixed-species grazing systems in production agriculture. When under metabolic stress, wild species will not rebreed, but rather will extend lactation (to nourish their current offspring). This bolsters the suggestion that lactation length be extended in dairy operations. Cooperation between animal scientists and ecologists could generate more valuable insight.},

Treated trees displayed precocious leaf senescence and visible symptoms of injury (dark brown/black upper surface stippling) exclusively observed on fully expanded leaves. In these leaves, ozone reduced parameters related to photochemistry (Chl content and maximum rate of photosynthetic electron transport) and photosynthetic CO(2) fixation [net CO(2) assimilation, Rubisco (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase) activity and maximum velocity of Rubisco for carboxylation]. In fully expanded leaves, the rate of photorespiration as estimated from Chl fluorescence was markedly impaired by the ozone treatment together with the activity of photorespiratory enzymes (Rubisco and glycolate oxidase). Immunoblot analysis revealed a decrease in the content of serine hydroxymethyltransferase in treated mature leaves, while the content of the H subunit of the glycine decarboxylase complex was not modified. Leaves in the early period of expansion were exempt from visible symptoms of injury and remained unaffected as regards all measured parameters. Leaves reaching full expansion under ozone exposure showed potential responses of protection (stimulation of mitochondrial respiration and transitory stomatal closure). Our data underline the major role of leaf phenology in ozone sensitivity of photosynthetic processes and reveal a marked ozone-induced inhibition of photorespiration.},

The most important of these are digestibility, ability to select feed, and achievement of a nutritionally adequate intake. Plant morphology, observed feeding behavior, body size, and gut architecture and size impinge upon these factors. Feeding behavior and dietary specializations are associated with adaptations of gut and mouth parts as well as body size. Parallel and overlapping behaviors occur among herbivores and particularly between ruminants and nonruminants. The conventional classifications of grazers, browsers, and selective feeders are blurred by these evolutionary developments.},

We investigated the mast patterns of the forest tree species common beech, common and sessile oak, Norway spruce and Scots pine in Central and Northern Europe over the last two to three decades. We analysed data from the International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests (ICP Forests) and additional Danish, German, Flemish and Swiss datasets.Within-plot synchrony of fructification intensity in individual trees was high in beech and spruce and lower in oak species and pine. Mast frequency increased in most regions for beech, whereas the other species showed mixed or no trends. Beech, oak species and spruce showed strong mast year (MY) synchrony, but pine did not. MY synchrony between species was only significant in Bavaria, in Switzerland and between beech, oak species and spruce in Denmark. The deciduous species showed bimodal normal masting, while the conifers had switching normal masting. Oak species and the conifers supported the large seed and the accessory costs hypotheses, and beech and spruce supported the economy of scale, predator satiation and resource allocation hypotheses.},

   abstract = {Diets of red Cervus elaphus and roe Capreolus capreolus deer in Scottish plantation forests were assessed by botanical and chemical analyses of 144 rumen samples. Samples were taken for summer and winter from four forests with a range of deer densities and ratios. Red deer ate mainly grasses in summer, and a mixture of sedges, rushes, grasses and heaths (ericoid plants) in winter. Roe deer ate predominantly forbs (herbaceous plants other than graminoids) in summer, and a mixture of forbs, heaths and tree and shrub browse in winter. The two species ate significantly different quantities of forbs and grasses (P< 0.001). Both species ate more grasses and forbs in summer, and more heaths in winter (P<0.05). There were few differences between forests for either red or roe deer in diet composition or its seasonal variation. Washed rumen contents of roe deer contained more nitrogen than did those of red deer (P &lt; 0.05) in both seasons, and both species contained more nitrogen in summer than in winter (P <0.05). Proportions of the main plant categories within rumens were compared with their abundance recorded in the ground flora. These comparisons showed roe deer to be highly selective, whilst red deer ate plants in proportions similar to their availability. Niche overlap increased and dietary niche breadths widened during the winter. The main overlap was for heaths Calluna vulgaris and Vaccinium myrtillus in winter. However, C. vulgaris is widespread and common and competition was considered to be more likely for forbs and possibly V. myrtillus: the use of some forb species by red deer in summer may limit their availability to roe deer in winter, when they remain an important dietary item. Consideration of the different digestive specializations of the two species suggested that any dietary competition is likely to affect roe deer more than red deer},

   abstract = {Given the key role of large herbivores on species and functional plant diversity, we aimed at better understanding the relationship between herbivory and plant communities mainly at a fine- scale, in order to reconcile objectives of population management and plant conservation. For this purpose, we used both taxonomic and functional approaches, and studied interactions at the inter- and intra-specific levels. We combined information coming from three databases: (1) diet data from DNA-metabarcoding applied on chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and mouflon (Ovis gmelini musimon) faeces from the Bauges Massif, (2) characteristics of plant communities (plant composition, biomass, phenology), (3) plant functional traits. Analyses of intra-specific variability of the three large herbivores allowed us to upscale the niche variation hypothesis (NVH) of Van Valen from the intra- to the inter- specific level, i.e. we observed a positive relationship between the species niche breadth and among-individual variation. Then, based on two chamois subpopulations living in pastures, one living in sympatry with the mouflon and the other living in allopatry, we revealed the absence of negative effects of the introduced mouflon population on native chamois population diet, both for the taxonomic and functional dietary niche. Analyses of diet selection criteria allowed us to highlight differences in choice criteria between chamois and mouflon in some seasons, which helped to partially explain the partial taxonomic and functional niche partitioning of the two species. Furthermore, the proposed scenario of the evolution of diet selection over the year for both species were consistent with ungulate-specific morpho-physiological features. Finally, contrary to the literature where no studies could discriminate the direct and indirect effects of functional traits on diet selection because of correlations, we used path analyses, which allowed us to show that in most cases, biomechanical traits had a direct effect on diet choices, whereas chemical traits had indirect effects. Furthermore, from a methodological point of view, we advised to use nitrogen fecal indices only to study the evolution of species-specific and location- specific population long-term diet quality, but not to compare diet quality between species, nor to study slight fluctuations at the intra-seasonal level. The complementarity of the approaches allowed us to better account for the structuration of herbivore communities, which should help to better assess the actual state and the evolution of relationships among individuals, species and their environment.},

   abstract = {The roe deer of Mediterranean habitats in the central and southern parts of Italy has recently been recognised as a distinct subspecies, Capreolus capreolus italicus. A population of this endangered subspecies has been monitored in the Preserve of Castelporziano, near Rome, since 1988. We observed an abrupt population decline in 2000, which may severely threaten the sustainability of this population. We evaluated the hypothesis that competition by fallow deer may be a principal cause of this decline. By a new and innovative methodology, we modelled the spatial distribution of fallow deer density (FDD) in the study area to show that 1) habitat quality for roe deer was an inverse function of FDD, 2) habitat apportionment between fallow and roe deerincreased as a function of FDD and by applying structural equation modelling 3) FDD was superior to habitat composition in explaining observed variations in home range size and probably in habitat quality for roe deer. This analysis is the first to document that inter-specific competition may influence the spatial behaviour of a deer species leading to poor phenotypic performance in the inferior competitor. We conclude that the conservation of this relict population would benefit by reducing fallow deer numbers at Castelporziano and from other measures aimed to decrease thelevel of inter-specific competition.},

   abstract = {In order to explore the effects of climate change on Mediterranean regenerating forests, we experimentally assessed the effects of increased drought on the reproductive attributes of Quercus ilex over a 4-year period (2005-2008). We also investigated whether traditional thinning (selection of one to a few stems per stump) could mitigate the consequences of increased drought in oak coppices. Increased drought reduced the number of reproductive trees, mean number of female flowers produced and acorn crop size, although most of these effects appeared only in the last 2 years of the experiment. In a different way, thinning enhanced all reproductive attributes, but its main effects were transient and covered only 1 or 2 years after the application of the treatments. Our results indicate that a moderate reduction in rainfall (15 per cent) reduces the reproductive ability of Q. ilex. This may have long-term negative consequences for recruitment as well as for the fauna feeding on acorns. Although traditional thinning may mitigate the consequences of increased drought, it has a remarkably short-term effect. This highlights the need to re-examine traditional forestry practices as potential adaptive strategies for coping with climate change in Mediterranean regenerating forests.},

We reviewed data on the diets of mouflon (Mediterranean island populations Ovis gmelini musimon and introduced hybridized populations Ovis gmelini musimonxOvis sp.) from 33 field studies (comprising 51 independent data points suitable for analysis) to detect general patterns in the botanical composition of the diet and identify ecological factors explaining its variation. We expected mouflon, generally classified as grazers, to include botanical entities other than grass in their diet, especially when they are forced to do so by low resource availability, and in certain seasons. 2. Diet composition was investigated based on samples of rumen content and faeces. We combined these data with environmental characteristics at each site using a co-inertia analysis. 3. As expected, grass often constituted the highest proportion in the diet (in 28 of the 51 data points) and represented on average 35% (range=0-91%) of mouflon diet, confirming the importance of this food for the species. However, referring strictly to commonly used thresholds (>75% or >90%) shows that the classification of mouflon as grazers could be questioned. Indeed, forbs and shrubs constituted 24% (range: 0-93%) and 16% (range: 0-55%) of their diet, respectively, so that mouflon should at least be considered as variable grazers. Forbs represented a high percentage of the overall diet in the Kerguelen Archipelago, southern Indian Ocean (autumn and winter: 73%) and Teide National Park, Canary Islands, Spain (autumn and winter: 83%), whereas shrubs represented a high proportion of the overall diet in Mediterranean areas (19%). 4. Diet composition varied with spatio-temporal variation in forage availability (documented as habitat related or seasonal variation), confirming that mouflon are able to feed on a large variety of plants. 5. Further investigations concerning both digestive morphology and consequences of the inclusion of browse in the diet on population dynamics of mouflon are needed to understand the persistence of this species over a wide range of habitats despite a potential mismatch between its digestive ability and its observed diet.},

Significant linear regressions were found for all the dietary and fecal chemical components, but only nitrogen showed a noteworthy result (R-2=0.76), very similar to the results obtained by several authors in other deer species (Robbins, 1993). Use of fecal nitrogen however, has been criticised because plant secondary compounds, such as tannin, may artificially inflate levels of fecal nitrogen; moreover, the binding effect of tannin is strongly reduced in mixed diets. After all, fecal nitrogen confirms its usefulness in studies about feeding strategies of free living ruminants.},

The population of Trois Fontaines (eastern France) was roughly constant in size throughout the study period, while in Chizé (western France), the population experienced frequent summer droughts and numbers decreased continuously during the study. Early survival of fawns was low and highly variable over the years at both Chizé and Trois Fontaines, and demonstrated marked variations between cohorts that need to be taken into account when modelling roe deer population dynamics. In Trois Fontaines, fawn survivial was positively correlated with early body growth and total rainfall in May and June. In Chizé, fawn survival decreased with increasing density and tended to increase with increasing rainfall in May and June and adult female body mass. These facotrs explained more than 75% of the variability in early survival observed in both populations. Variation between cohorts had different consequences for the two populations. At Trois Fontaines, cohort variation was limited to a numerical effect on early survival. However at Chizé, cohort variation was long-lasting and affected the phenotypic quality of survivors at later ages, and thereby future survival and breeding abilities (both numerical and quality effects). Male and female fawns had similar survival over their first summer in both populations. This result contrasts with the lower survival of young males oserved in ungulates. Two ultimate causes can be proposed to account for the low and variable survival of roe deer fawns over the first summer: the high energy expenditures incurred by does during each breeding attempt and/or the low absolute body size of newborn roe deer fawns.},

Their destructive feeding habits, primarily rooting disturbance, can reduce plant cover, diversity, and regeneration. Furthermore, predation and habitat destruction by boar can greatly affect animal communities. Effects of wild boar on fungi and aquatic communities are scarcely studied, and soil properties and processes seem more resistant to disturbance. Wild boar also affect humans’ economy as they cause crop damage and transmit diseases to livestock and wildlife. In this review, we found that most of the published literature examines boar effects in their introduced range and little is available from the native distribution. Because most of the research describes direct effects of wild boar on plant communities and predation on some animal communities, less is known about indirect effects on ecosystem function. Finally, predictive research and information on ecosystem recovery after wild boar removal are scarce. We identified research gaps and urge the need to lower wild boar densities. Identifying commonalities among wild boar impacts on native ecosystems across its introduced range will help in the design of management strategies.},

   abstract = {Harvest records are often assumed to off er an indirect measure of population abundance in huntable species. However, this requires population density changes are refl ected in comparable linear changes in harvest rates. We tested this assump- tion for common snipe Gallinago gallinago , common wood pigeon Columba palumbus , coot Fulica atra , grey partridge Perdix perdix , roe deer Capreolus capreolus and brown hare Lepus europaeus in Denmark. If we consider hunting a form of predator – prey interaction, the annual kill can be viewed as a predator functional response to prey population size. Convergence of the annual kill to a type I functional response with similar auto-correlative structures in the harvest and count data would support the hypothesis that fl uctuations in harvest and population abundance occurred with similar periodicity. Th e annual kill of common snipe showed the best fi t to a type I functional response to the point count indices, with similar auto-correlative structures in the two variables. Other species showed diff erent functional responses, the result of hunter behaviour, such as voluntary hunting restraint on species of concern and saturation eff ects from rapidly expand- ing abundant species. Relationships between the annual kill and population abundance were complex and incorporation of hunting legislation changes improved optimal model fi ts between harvest statistics and count data. Consideration of the validity of the underlying assumptions is necessary before harvest records are used as an index for population size. It is essential that detectability/accessibility of a species does not change systematically over time. Such bias may derive from habitat shifts, diff erence in timing of counts and hunting harvest, changes in migration patterns and annual reproduction and mortality. We recommend the continued collation of hunting harvest statistics, supported by sociological studies, to provide insight into the mechanisms that aff ect the hunting eff ort, to understand relationships between harvest statistics and population abundance.},

Preferred foods (other than the introduced grasses) were scarce, particularly in the beech forest. A comparison of probable food production and use within the browse zone indicated that, at present densities, deer were not likely to prevent regeneration of the less preferred species (including silver beech). In the beech forest, regeneration of most sub canopy tree species will be minimal while deer densities remain near present levels (0.1 deer ha-1).

   abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is endemic in Eurasian wild boar ( Sus scrofa) and red deer ( Cervus elaphus) in south central Spain, where evidence suggests transmission to domestic cattle. Known risk factors for TB at the interface between livestock and wild ungulate species include density and spatial overlap, particularly around waterholes during summer. We evaluated the effectiveness of selective exclusion measures for reducing direct and indirect interaction between extensive beef cattle and wild ungulates at waterholes as an alternative for the integrated control of TB. We first monitored 6 water points (WP) with infrared-triggered cameras at a TB positive cattle farm to quantify interactions. We then assigned 3 WP to be "cattle-only" and 3 to be "wildlife-only". Cattle-only WP were surrounded with a wildlife-proof fence (2.5. m high) and an original design of cattle-specific gate. Wildlife-only WP were surrounded by a fence that wild ungulates could breach but cattle could not (1.2. m high). Red deer, roe deer ( Capreolus capreolus) and wild boar easily jumped or undercrossed this fence. Wildlife-only fences were 100% effective in preventing cattle access to WP and did not impede wildlife use. Many cows learned to operate the cattle-specific gate quickly and others followed and learned from them. Within 2 weeks, around 70% of cows actively entered and exited through the cattle-specific gate. We demonstrate how simple, low-cost fencing strategies can serve as biosecurity measures to substantially reduce direct and indirect contact between cattle and wild ungulates, serving to reduce the potential for TB transmission. Our designs can be used in the context of integral plans to mitigate disease transmission between cattle and wildlife, and have potential for protecting or segregating the use of a variety of resources in different contexts. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Capreolus capreolus in Trois Fontaines, a 1360ha reserve in E France, faced severe winters. The size of this highly productive population was roughly constant during the study period. In Chize, a 2660ha reserve in W France with mild winters, roe deer showed density dependence in reproduction and body weight. Females generally survived better than males, the survival rates of prime-age adults were the highest, and survival decreased after seven years of age. Only the severe winters affected markedly the survivorship of roe deer. In Chize only, juveniles survived markedly less well than prime-age adults. Since physical maturity was reached later in Chize, the length of the critical stage for survival may be sensitive to population dynamics. Survival of juvenile roe deer thus appears to be very sensitive to external influences. Despite their marked differences between the two populations, survival rates of prime-age adults were similar. Thus, survival of prime-age adult roe deer appears to be relatively insensitive to external influences. The differences in survival between sexes for prime-age adults was close to values observed in dimorphic and polygynous ungulates, but roe deer only exhibit a marginal sexual dimorphism in size, a small breeding group size and no sex differences in fawn mortality. Costs of sexual selection cannot account for this gender effect in roe deer, and changes in social interactions between females in these high-density populations could be involved. The decline of survival after seven years of age was probably related to tooth wear. -from Authors},

   abstract = {Coppice forestry is a conventional silvicultural practice that takes advantage of a tree's capacity to respond to disturbances by sprouting. Sprouting capacity is determined by many intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as parent tree age/size, understory light availability and deer browsing, which, under closed canopy conditions are important limiting factors for stump survival or sprout growth. However, the combined effect of potentially confounding abiotic and biotic factors on stump survival and sprout growth remains elusive, even more so under closed canopy conditions. This study aims to quantify the effect of deer browsing on stump mortality and sprout growth under closed-canopy conditions and to compare this effect with other known determinants. Here we show that stump survival and sprout growth in sessile oak (Quercus petraea Matt.) depend on deer browsing, understory light availability and the diameter of the parent tree. By studying paired fenced-unfenced plots, we confirmed that deer browsing decreased stump survival and inhibited sprout growth. Furthermore, by taking advantage of a gradient in understory light availability in monospecific and mixed stands of sessile oak and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), we showed a clear positive linear relationship between sprout growth and light availability. This relationship explained the observed differences among stand composition types. Finally, we found that increased understory light availability did not compensate for losses due to deer browsing. In the absence of deer browsing, our results demonstrate that sessile oak stumps regenerate well under closed-canopy conditions and maintain a moderate sprouting capacity at least until the age of 70–80 years old. Partial thinning could therefore be a potential tool to renew light-demanding tree species such as sessile oak in mixed high-forest stands. Nevertheless, we do not recommend coppicing sessile oak under closed canopies unless the oak stumps are protected from deer browsing and understory light availability is optimized as much as possible despite closed-canopy-management objectives.},

The cover and height of the vegetation, as well as the number of plant species increased rapidly during the first two years after cutting, whereafter these variables continued to increase, although more slowly.

The height of the slash was lower on older clearcuts. Roe deer density increased with clearcut age. Browsing occurred during winter and the frequency of browsed seedlings was 31.2% in the 1993–1994 period and 24.8% in the 1994–1995 period. During both years the browsing damage tended to be highest on the one-year old clearcuts, but the effect was not statistically significant ps0.058.. The level of damage was about equal on the clearcuts of other ages. The level of browsing damage was not correlated with the quantity or quality of associated vegetation, slash quantity, or roe deer density on the clearcuts.},

The sheep were fed a diet of 239 g of alfalfa haylage and 814 g of barley concentrate per day (DM basis) divided into 12 equal portions and allocated at 2-h intervals. A pulse dose of 300 mg of 15N as [15N]NH4Cl was administered into the rumen (on d 1 and 15) and 300 mg of 15N as [15N]urea was administered intravenously to the blood (d 8). Enrichment of 15N was measured in ruminal NH3-N, bacterial N, and plasma urea N over a period of 35 h. Total collection of urine was made for 5 d and analyzed for purine derivatives to calculate the flow of microbial N. Ruminal parameters and nutrient digestibilities were also measured. Sheep were defaunated using a rumen washing procedure 50 d prior to measurements in the defaunated period. Sheep were refaunated with ruminal contents from a faunated sheep receiving the same diet. Measurements began 26 d following refaunation, at which time protozoal numbers had returned to those in the originally faunated sheep. Data reported in parentheses are for faunated, defaunated, and refaunated sheep, respectively. Total culturable and cellulolytic bacterial numbers were unaffected by defaunation, but there was an increase in flow of microbial N from the rumen (10.8, 17.3, and 11.1 g N/d; P < .05) in the defaunated period. Flux, irreversible loss, and intraruminal recycling of NH3-N and recycling of NH3-N from plasma urea N were not affected by defaunation. Defaunation had no effect on reducing the absolute amount (13.8, 10.0, and 11.3 g N/d; P > .20) of bacterial N recycling and the percentage of N flux through the bacterial N pool. Total-tract digestion was reduced in defaunated compared with faunated sheep by 8, 17, 15, and 32% for OM, N, NDF, and ADF, respectively. In conclusion, defaunation improved ruminal N metabolism through the enhancement of bacterial protein synthesis, and improvement in the flow of microbial protein to the host animal.},

   abstract = {The effects of deer browsing and slash removal on vegetation succession were studied on 20 clearcuts in southern Sweden. The experiment was established over a 5-year period (1989-1993). Each clearcut was divided into two parts: On one part 80% of the slash was removed, while on the other it was retained and evenly distributed. Field vegetation was studied on 0.5 m2plots on which the plant species present were identified, and biomass was measured by destructive harvesting in the late summers of 1989-1996. The effects of browsing by roe deer (Capreolus capreolus L.) and moose (Alces alces L.) were assessed by comparing vegetation inside exclosures to that found outside them. The exclosures were established in both slash-retained and slash-removed areas in the winter of 1992-1993. On 1-year-old clearcuts there was almost no vegetation, whereas 6-year-old ones contained about 4 t (dry weight) of biomass per hectare. Total plant biomass was higher inside exclosures, but was not influenced by slash removal. Neither slash removal nor exclosure affected the biomass of grasses and sedges, which dominated the vegetation. Herbs, trees and shrubs showed more growth inside exclosures and on areas where the slash had been retained. For the study period as a whole the biomass of dwarf shrubs was not influenced by exclosure or slash removal. However, on the oldest clearcuts there were more dwarf shrubs on areas where slash had been removed and there were also signs of browsing influence on dwarf shrubs. In total, about 50 plant species were recorded. However, the most common species, that is, Deshampsia flexuosa (L.) Trin., Betula spp., Rubus idaeus (L.), and Calluna vulgaris (L.) Hull, made up more than 95% of the total biomass and one species, Deshampsia flexuosa (a grass), accounted for up about 75% of the plant biomass. Total biomass was higher and plant succession tended to occur faster inside exclosures. The average number of plant species was not influenced, and frequencies of common plant species was affected relatively little by the exclosures. Slash removal had no influence on the total plant biomass, and the effect on plant succession was less pronounced than the effect of exclosure. There were more plant species on areas where slash had been retained than on areas from which it had been removed, and the frequencies of several common species were strongly influenced by slash removal.},

Sixty-eight faecal samples collected in April of 2000 and 2002 from adult animals maintained on ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) were used to determine the ability of NIRS to distinguish faeces by sex and/or species in red (Cervus elaphus) versus fallow (Dama dama) deer. Two-block partial least squares procedures indicate a high degree of discrimination (R2> 0.90) between groups within year. Discriminant equations developed from samples within either year were ineffective in identifying sex or species in the other year's samples (<60% correct). Dissimilar forage conditions (i.e. diet quality) between the 2 years probably contributed the greatest amount of variation in faecal spectra, thus diminishing any possible animal related effects. Combining both years samples yielded a high degree of discrimination (R2> 0.87) and, when the resultant discriminant equations were applied to validation samples withheld from calibration, correctly identified 80-100% of faecal samples grouped by sex, species, sex within species, and species within sex. Fecal NIRS successfully discriminated sex and species in red and fallow deer maintained in unisex groups on a monoculture pasture. The use of faecal NIRS to characterize wildlife population demographics and non-invasively monitor individual animal physiology should now be explored in free-ranging animals. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {The impact that herbivore damage has on plant fitness depends on the environmental conditions in which the plant is growing. It has long been assumed that a plant's tolerance of herbivory should be greater in low-stress, resource-rich environments, and this assumption has been formalized in what has become known as the compensatory continuum hypothesis (CCH). Despite the widespread acceptance of the CCH, recently accumulating results from numerous studies relating resource levels to tolerance of herbivory show that the relationship is not as simple as this hypothesis predicts. In fact, plants have often been found to be less tolerant of a given amount of herbivory in resource-rich environments than they are of the same amount of herbivory in resource-poor environments. In this article, we present a new model, the limiting resource model (LRM), that can more reliably explain the range of observed effects of resource levels on tolerance. The main advance of this model is that it specifically considers which factors are limiting plant fitness and which resources are affected by particular herbivores. The LRM is presented in a general and flexible form as a flowchart with seven pathways to three potential outcomes: greater tolerance, equal tolerance, or lower tolerance in low- vs high-resource environments. We then review a specific example to illustrate each of these seven pathways with a study from the published literature. We finish with a description of four general criteria to direct the design of future studies to test the predictions of the LRM.},

   abstract = {1. Timing and synchrony of reproduction are regarded as crucially important factors for fitness in seasonal environments. Natural selection has probably favoured temperate and arctic female herbivores that match reproduction with onset of plant growth in spring. However, breeding synchrony may also be affected by variation in phenotypic quality of females in a population, because females in poor body condition have been found to delay ovulation and subsequent calving. 2. We compared breeding phenology, i.e. the timing and synchrony of rutting (roaring, sexual aggregation) and calving of red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) in France (latitude: 49 degrees N) and Norway (latitude: 63 degrees N). We hypothesized (H-1) that calving and rutting were later at the site with latest onset of plant growth. 3. We further quantified overall environmental predictability as the sum of annual constancy and seasonality and tested three different (not mutually exclusive) hypotheses about breeding synchrony: (H-2a) the population experiencing most seasonal plant phenology should show the highest breeding synchrony; (H-2b) overall predictability of plant phenology should determine breeding synchrony; and (H-2c) breeding should be more synchronized in the population with lowest female body weight variation within age classes because they ovulate more synchronously. 4. Calving and rutting, as well as onset of plant phenology, were later in Norway than in France, complying with the first hypothesis. Plant growth in spring was overall more predictable and also more seasonal in Norway than France. Hence we expected higher breeding synchrony in Norway than in France according to H-2a and H-2b. Variance in female body weight was slightly higher in France than in Norway, which should also cause more synchronized breeding in Norway than in France (H-2c). Contrary to all predictions, variance in rutting and calving dates was around two times higher in Norway than in France. 5. We suggest two alternative explanations of breeding synchrony. A more variable topography in Norway can make optimal birth date more variable on a local scale than in France, thereby maintaining a higher genetic variance for calving date in Norwegian red deer. Further, population age structure may play a role, as ovulation varies according to female age. Clearly, processes of breeding synchrony are far more complex than previously realized.},

   abstract = {Browsing by deer has been identified as an important factor in preventing the regeneration of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) woodland. In this 4-year study, we monitored use by red deer (Cervus elaphus) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and the incidence and severity of browsing to individual saplings across a range of Caledonian pinewood sites in the Highlands of Scotland and related sapling growth to browsing history and site characteristics. Browsing incidence during winter increased with use (as indexed by dung counts) by red deer, but not roe deer, and increased with sapling height and the apparency of the sapling. The form of these relationships was influenced by the characteristics of the ground vegetation. In contrast, browsing during summer increased with use by roe deer, but not red deer, and was most frequent on saplings of around 1 m tall. In both winter and summer, saplings showing a history of previous browsing were more likely to be browsed, than saplings of the same height with little or no browsing history. The length of the leading shoot varied with aspect, soil type and the sapling's height. Annual variation in shoot length was considerably greater than variation between sites. Saplings with a history of previous browsing showed some degree of compensatory growth, with an increased leader length, but decreased basal diameter increment. The severity of browsing had a significant effect on leader length, but much less of an effect than browsing to the leader itself. The severity of browsing had very little effect on basal diameter increment. This study demonstrates the complexity of factors influencing the suppression of natural regeneration by deer, and we recommend combining further field studies with simulation modelling to allow predictions to be made of the conditions under which regeneration is likely to be successful in the presence of deer. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Karst. seedlings. The cover and height of the vegetation, as well as the number of plant species increased rapidly during the first two years after cutting, whereafter these variables continued to increase, although more slowly. Hairy grass Deshampsia flexuosa L..made up about 90% of the vegetation cover. The nitrogen concentration of hairy grass was highest in two- and three-year old clearcuts. The height of the slash was lower on older clearcuts. Roe deer density increased with clearcut age. Browsing occurred during winter and the frequency of browsed seedlings was 31.2% in the 1993–1994 period and 24.8% in the 1994–1995 period. During both years the browsing damage tended to be highest on the one-year old clearcuts, but the effect was not statistically significant ps0.058.. The level of damage was about equal on the clearcuts of other ages. The level of browsing damage was not correlated with the quantity or quality of associated vegetation, slash quantity, or roe deer density on the clearcuts.},

   abstract = {Abstract : Habitat ranking is often assumed to reflect food availability, but habitat selection may involve trade-offs, for example, between selecting for food or cover. We tested whether the habitat selection of 27 radio-collared European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and 10 free-ranging domestic sheep (Ovis aries ) on a forest range in southern Norway reflected resource availability. We predicted that ruminants of different feeding types would use habitats according to the main forage class, but that antipredator behavior might remove the correlation between habitat selection and food availability, thus making temporal and spatial scaling crucial. As predicted, habitat selection by sheep was highly correlated with grass availability on both the home-range and study-area scales. The habitat ranking of roe deer habitat selection did not correlate with the availability of herbs on either scale, but rather was correlated with the availability of canopy cover. We found a clear effect of temporal scale on habitat selection by roe deer. During summer, roe deer used forest habitats with more forage to a greater extent when they were active than when they were inactive, and tended to use habitats with greater availability of herbs at night. We conclude that scale-dependent trade-offs in habitat selection may cause inconsistent habitat rankings when pooled across temporal and spatial scales.},

   abstract = {Large herbivores play a major role in shaping vegetation community dynamics through selective consumption of particular plants and plant communities. An understanding of the factors influencing diet selection at the level of individual bites ('bite scale') is important for prediction of the impact of herbivores on vegetation at the habitat scale. Bite-scale diet selection represents an integration of the twin goals of maximizing nutrient intake and minimizing toxin intake. Recent research with ruminants in pen-fed situations has shown that animals are able to make choices between artificial foods that maximize growth and other production variables. The role of post-ingestive feedback as an important mechanism for allowing animals to assess the nutritional quality of particular foods, and so select optimal diets, has been recognized in a number of recent experiments. Our understanding of the role of toxin intake minimization in diet selection decisions is more rudimentary. An important advance in the last decade has been the acknowledgement of the role of post-ingestive feedback and learning as a mechanism for avoidance of dietary toxicity. Further research is required to assess the importance of these processes in relation to free-grazing animals. The extent to which an understanding of bite-scale diet selection can be used to predict habitat utilization is not well understood. At the habitat scale additional factors such as predator avoidance, social constraints, avoidance of parasitism and microclimatic effects have an important influence on foraging decisions. Future research needs to focus on developing a quantitative understanding of such decisions at the habitat scale.},

   abstract = {1. There is much interest in how herbivores interact with plant communities, but the association between foliar traits and the feeding behaviour of invading browsing mammals has not been explored in this context. 2. We investigated whether eight foliar traits predicted the preferences of invasive Red Deer for 21 woody plant species in lowland forest in southern New Zealand. 3. The four models with substantial support for predicting variation in two indices of diet selection all included one or more traits related to foliar fibre (acid detergent fibre; acid detergent cellulose; acid detergent lignin). In all models the coefficients were negative, indicating that as the concentrations of foliar fibre increased, the preference of deer for foliage decreased. 4. Our results thus link the feeding behaviour of Red Deer with previously demonstrated shifts in the composition of New Zealand forests towards understorey species and leaf litter with high concentrations of foliar fibre.

   abstract = {The use of forage brassicas, such as kale, in diets of ruminants is typically constrained by the presence of anti-metabolites that break down in the rumen to cause detrimental effects after absorption including haemolytic anaemia and tissue damage. Ensilage of kale before feeding may provide conditions that favour the degradation of potentially toxic anti-metabolites, thereby improving the nutritive value of the feed. An experiment was conducted with eighty Scottish Blackface housed lambs, in which four levels of kale silage were used to replace grass silage and in which the forage component comprised around 60% of the finishing diet. Productivity of lambs was not affected other than to increase the killing-out percentage of the lambs. Glucosinolate concentrations in kale were markedly reduced by the ensiling process. Haematological parameters, such as packed cell volume, haemoglobin concentration and the presence of Heinz-Ehrlich bodies, were not significantly affected by replacing grass silage with kale silage. Similarly, there were no significant effects arising from the dietary treatments on the blood plasma components, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, blood urea nitrogen, tri-iodothyroxine and thyroxine, which are conventional measures of glucosinolate toxicity. The results indicated that the ensilage of kale reduces its toxicity and hence removes constraints on the maximum inclusion levels in the diet. Also, it was possible to reduce the potential contamination of carcasses with soil by lambs not grazing the crop and thus keeping fleeces clean.},

   abstract = {Abstract To indicate possibilities for the use of forages from seminatural grasslands in ruminant production systems, a literature study to describe the nutritive value of those forages was carried out. In species-rich grasslands, the digestibility of forages is usually lower than the digestibility of forages produced by grasslands used for intensive production. There is also more variation within a species-rich sward, because of different stages of maturity of the individual species and because of likely variations in digestibility among forage species independent of stage of maturity. Moreover, the presence of dicotyledonous species may have a positive or negative effect on digestibility. In forages from seminatural grasslands, the relationship between chemical composition and digestibility differs from that of Lolium perenne, which is often used as a research standard. Therefore, predictions of the digestibility of species-rich forage can be inaccurate. The relationship between in vivo and in vitro digestibility may also be different from the relationship that is common for L. perenne. In some cases, the in vivo digestibility is higher than the in vitro value, as calibrations are based on L. perenne. Therefore, the quality of forages from seminatural grasslands might be higher than predicted, and this may increase the scope for practical use of this kind of forage in ruminant nutrition systems.},

   abstract = {Background and aims – Polystigma rubrum forms orange-red stromata on the surface of living leaves of Prunus spinosa and P. domestica. Records suggests that this fungus now has a much more limited distribution in Britain than recorded in the 19th and early 20th century. Methods – We studied the local distribution of the fungus in the Burren Hills of western Ireland where it remains very common. Key results – Assessment of the local distribution of the fungus over two years found stromata to occur more frequently on P. spinosa leaves in hedgerows than woodlands. On individual trees in areas of open limestone pavement, the frequency of stromata was ten times higher in 2016 than 2015, possibly related to interannual rainfall differences. On hedgerow trees subjected to winter flooding, stromata were much less abundant, whereas stromata were more abundant on leaves also infected by the gall mite Eriophyes prunispinosae. The identity of Po. rubrum was confirmed by ITS sequencing. Conclusion – At a field location where Po. rubrum stromata are present in unusually high abundance, the distribution of stromata on trees in different habitats showed high levels of variation linked to both habitat and the presence of gall mites. Further work is required to determine whether variation in leaf surface and soil moisture are the key determinants of the observed distribution. Such investigations may reveal why Po. rubrum, once common in northern Europe is now restricted mainly to westerly, coastal locations.},

Within the Ipomoea species tested, there was no tendency for species having one defense to lack others, i.e. indole alkaloids were no less numerous in species with defense nectaries than those without. This evidence is therefore inconsistent with the idea that allocation of resources to one defense will favor reduction of other defenses.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Plants are likely to invest in multiple defences, given the variety of sources of biotic and abiotic damage to which they are exposed. However, little is known about syndromes of defence across plant species and how these differ in contrasting environments. Here an investigation is made into the association between carbon-based chemical and mechanical defences, predicting that species that invest heavily in mechanical defence of leaves will invest less in chemical defence. METHODS: A combination of published and unpublished data is used to test whether species with tougher leaves have lower concentrations of phenolics, using 125 species from four regions of Australia and the Pacific island of New Caledonia, in evergreen vegetation ranging from temperate shrubland and woodland to tropical shrubland and rainforest. Foliar toughness was measured as work-to-shear and specific work-to-shear (work-to-shear per unit leaf thickness). Phenolics were measured as 'total phenolics' and by protein precipitation (an estimate of tannin activity) per leaf dry mass. KEY RESULTS: Contrary to prediction, phenolic concentrations were not negatively correlated with either measure of leaf toughness when examined across all species, within regions or within any plant community. Instead, measures of toughness (particularly work-to-shear) and phenolics were often positively correlated in shrubland and rainforest (but not dry forest) in New Caledonia, with a similar trend suggested for shrubland in south-western Australia. The common feature of these sites was low concentrations of soil nutrients, with evidence of P limitation. CONCLUSIONS: Positive correlations between toughness and phenolics in vegetation on infertile soils suggest that additive investment in carbon-based mechanical and chemical defences is advantageous and cost-effective in these nutrient-deficient environments where carbohydrate may be in surplus.},

   abstract = {The spatial grazing patterns of red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) in a subalpine grassland ecosystem of the Swiss National Park were analysed with reference to the phosphorus content in the topsoil and to the former agricultural management system. Changes in the composition of the vegetation and in plant species richness were studied on permanent plots set up between 1917 and 1945 in areas which today are heavily grazed by red deer, and were related to the development of the red deer population. The spatial grazing patterns of red deer are, 80 years after the Park's foundation, still determined by former agricultural use. Red deer prefer the most phosphorus-rich, formerly irrigated parts for grazing. Grazing by red deer was found to be the driving force behind temporal changes in the vegetation observed on the subalpine grasslands. Plant succession has proceeded faster in the preferred grazing areas and the vegetation has adapted to the grazing pressure with a decrease in tall-growing plant species. At the same time, the abundance of unpalatable species has increased due to (i) morphological defences, (ii) spatial avoidance, i.e. by growing close to the ground and (iii) temporal avoidance because they have a short life-span (annuals). Changes in vegetation composition have coincided with a sharp increase in species richness. Between 1917 and 1999, the number of plant species has doubled on average. We found a highly significant correlation between the changes in the numbers of plant species and red deer, with species richness increasing with increasing deer density. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Plant communities are often dispersal-limited and zoochory can be an efficient mechanism for plants to colonize new patches of potentially suitable habitat. We predicted that seed dispersal by ungulates acts as an ecological filter – which differentially affects individuals according to their characteristics and shapes species assemblages – and that the filter varies according to the dispersal mechanism (endozoochory, fur-epizoochory and hoof-epizoochory). We conducted two-step individual participant data meta-analyses of 52 studies on plant dispersal by ungulates in fragmented landscapes, compar- ing eight plant traits and two habitat indicators between dispersed and non-dispersed plants. We found that ungulates dispersed at least 44% of the available plant species. Moreover, some plant traits and habitat indicators increased the likeli- hood for plant of being dispersed. Persistent or nitrophilous plant species from open habitats or bearing dry or elongated diaspores were more likely to be dispersed by ungulates, whatever the dispersal mechanism. In addition, endozoochory was more likely for diaspores bearing elongated appendages whereas epizoochory was more likely for diaspores released relatively high in vegetation. Hoof-epizoochory was more likely for light diaspores without hooked appendages. Fur- epizoochory was more likely for diaspores with appendages, particularly elongated or hooked ones. We thus observed a gradient of filtering effect among the three dispersal mechanisms. Endozoochory had an effect of rather weak intensity (impacting six plant characteristics with variations between ungulate-dispersed and non-dispersed plant species mostly below 25%), whereas hoof-epizoochory had a stronger effect (eight characteristics included five ones with above 75% varia- tion), and fur-epizoochory an even stronger one (nine characteristics included six ones with above 75% variation). Our results demonstrate that seed dispersal by ungulates is an ecological filter whose intensity varies according to the dispersal mechanism considered. Ungulates can thus play a key role in plant community dynamics and have implications for plant spatial distribution patterns at multiple scales.},

   abstract = {The effect of deer on woodland vegetation is reviewed, focusing on processes that are likely to bring about changes in structure and composition. By browsing on tree seedlings, shrubs and climbers, deer tend to reduce stem densities, limit height growth and reduce foliage density, creating a more open understorey. Light penetration to the ground can be increased, providing more plant cover close to the ground surface. Using results from 13 studies in temperate woodlands, the effects of deer browsing on the species richness and diversity of trees were analysed using general linear models. The results show that deer tend to reduce the diversity of seedlings, and that the effect is greater at higher deer densities. Differences in susceptibility of tree species were evident, with some species being depleted by deer at all sites, whereas others declined in some sites but increased in others. The effects of deer on the amount and composition of regeneration appear to depend on site characteristics, including the light regime and composition of the ground vegetation. Although few studies of seed dispersal by ungulates (endozoochory) have been made in Britain, deer have been shown to be effective seed dispersers of a number of plant species. Plants with small hard seeds are most likely to survive digestion. Most of the species known to be dispersed in this way include grasses and small herbs. In view of the fact that dispersal mechanisms of many woodland species are not well understood, endozoochory may be more important than is generally realized.},

   abstract = {Mast-seeding is the synchronized and intermittent production of a large seed crop by a population of plants. The cascading effects of masting on wildlife have been well documented in granivorous rodents. Yet, the effects of mast-seeding are potentially further reaching, since a number of generalist species can take advantage of mast years. We employed a full-text search algorithm to identify all papers that discussed effects of mast-seeding on wildlife, in addition to typical searches of titles and abstracts. We aimed to evaluate the breadth of wildlife species for which mast years are thought to be important drivers. In addition, we tested three hypotheses derived from past reviews: 1) species with lower reproductive potential (lower average litter size) are more likely to show aggregative responses to mast-seeding, 2) species with lower body sizes (lower mobility) are more likely to show reproductive responses, and 3) indirect consumers of mast (predators) are more likely to show aggregative responses than direct consumers. We found 186 articles including reports of response of 122 species of vertebrates to mast-seeding. Expectations were partly confirmed: relationships 1) and 2) held for mammals, but not for birds. However, 3) direct consumers were more likely than indirect consumers to show aggregative responses. Our tests of the first two hypotheses question the generality of past predictions for taxa other than mammals. Our test of the third hypothesis suggests that responses of direct and indirect consumers might depend on the type of resource pulse. Many of the examples in our analysis come from systems in which wildlife responses to mast have been less rigorously documented than the examples in past reviews. They suggest the range of wildlife responses to mast-seeding are more taxonomically and ecologically diverse than past reviews have widely recognized and point to directions for future research.},

   abstract = {Resource Pulses are infrequent, large-magnitude, and short-duration events of increased resource availability. They include a diverse set of extreme events in a wide range of ecosystems, but identifying general patterns among the diversity of pulsed resource phenomena in nature remains an important challenge. Here we present a meta-analysis of resource pulse-consumer interactions that addresses four key questions: (1) Which characteristics of pulsed resources best predict their effects on consumers? (2) Which characteristics of consumers best predict their responses to resource pulses? (3) How do the effects of resource Pulses differ in different ecosystems? (4) What are the indirect effects of resource pulses in communities'? To investigate these questions, we built a data set of diverse Pulsed resource-consumer interactions from around the world, developed metrics to compare the effects of resource pulses across disparate systems, and conducted multilevel regression analyses to examine the manner in which variation in the characteristics of resource pulse-consumer interactions affects important aspects Of Consumer responses. Resource pulse magnitude, resource trophic level, resource Pulse duration, ecosystem type and subtype, consumer response mechanisms, and consumer body mass were found to be key. explanatory factors predicting the magnitude, duration, and timing of consumer responses. Larger consumers showed more persistent responses to resource pulses, and reproductive responses were more persistent than aggregative responses. Aquatic systems showed shorter temporal lags between peaks of resource availability and consumer response compared to terrestrial systems, and temporal lags were also shorter for smaller consumers compared to larger consumers. The magnitude of consumer responses relative to their resource pulses was generally smaller for the direct consumers of primary resource pulses, compared to consumers at greater trophic distances from the initial resource pulse. In specific systems, this data set showed both attenuating and amplifying indirect effects. We consider the mechanistic processes behind these patterns and their implications for the ecology of resource pulses.},

   abstract = {This review aims to evaluate the contribution of near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) to monitor nutrition in small ruminants, with particular emphasis on the use of feed spectra and fecal spectra. NIRS provides satisfactory accuracy in the analysis of the chemical constituents of feeds for small ruminants, e.g., crude protein and cell wall composition, and is sometimes better than in vitro procedures for predicting in vivo digestibility and the available energy in feeds. In addition, in vitro digestibility can be accurately estimated by NIRS. The effective rumen degradability of protein could potentially be accurately predicted by NIRS, which would eliminate the need for rumen-fistulated animals. Good accuracy in the prediction of tannins has been reported for narrow, single-species applications, as well as for broad arrays of browse species. The identification of NIR segments corresponding to undigested entities has potential to help in providing spectral markers of digestibility. Fecal output can easily be evaluated, using the NIRS-aided analysis of polyethylene glycol (PEG) administered as external indigestible marker. Analysis of NIR spectra of the feces enables the accurate prediction of the chemical characteristics of the feed (dry matter digestibility and crude protein, cell wall attributes, PEG-binding tannins) in stall-fed and grazing animals, and to some extent, of the botanical composition of diets at pasture. Thus, fecal NIRS methodology holds the potential to provide nutritional diagnoses for farmers raising small ruminant. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {A common assumption in studies of seed predation is that seeds survive attack and are dispersed only when animals fail to find seeds, drop undamaged seeds or fail to recover seeds after they are cached. This study, however, suggests that many acorn consumers consistently eat only a portion of the cotyledon of several species of acorns and thereby permit embryo survival. Several vertebrates gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis), common grackles (Quiscalus quiscula) and blue jays (Cyanocita cristata)T were observed to consume only 30-60% of the cotyledon from the basal portion (cap end) of willow oak (Quercus phellos) acorns. Gray squirrels exhibited a similar preference for the basal end of acorns of several other species of red oaks (Q. rubra, Q. laevis, Q. nigra, Q. palustris and Q. coccinea) from a wide geographic region. In addition, acorn weevil larvae (Curculio sp.) were observed significantly (>35%) more often in the basal portion than in the apical end of Q. alba acorns. Chemical analyses of acorns from two tree species revealed that the concentration of protein-precipitable phenolics (primarily tannins) was 12.5% (Q. phellos) and 84.2% (Q. laevis) higher in the apical portion of the seeds where the embryo is located. Moreover, germination experiments revealed equal or greater germination frequencies for partially consumed acorns than for intact acorns. We suggest that the higher tannin levels may render the apical portioness palatable, and thereby increase the probability of embryo survival after attack by seed consumers.},

The spherical convex densiometer is a simple instrument that allows to evaluate the canopy openness (CO) by counting the number of ‘canopy’ dots on a grid lying on a convex mirror reflecting the canopy. In this contribution, we compared the performances of this instrument in mixed oak–beech hardwood forests spanning the lower end of the light gradient [1–17 % above canopy photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)] to two reference techniques: PAR measurements and fish-eye photography, based on a detailed analysis of its functioning. Discrep- ancies between the densiometer and the fish-eye estimates of CO were due to a combination of differences in dot resolution, dot counting and portion of the hemisphere considered. By contrast, the various effects of operator on densiometer estimates, including the influence of confor- mation on the angle of view, were found to be relatively minor. Densiometer readings were closely related to the relative light intensity assessed by PAR sensors in overcast conditions, which suggests that the use of this inexpensive tool should be expanded.},

   abstract = {Many techniques have been developed to estimate mean available light in forest understories. The standard methods estimate average seasonal PAR by recording it in situ with quantum sensors or through simulation using hemispherical image analysis (HIA). Other techniques have been developed to overcome some of the drawbacks of the standard methods, such as high cost, cumbersome equipment, user bias, and limited replication. The "Overcast" method allows rapid evaluation of average seasonal PAR in most situations by taking instantaneous measurements, but is restricted by the overcast sky conditions required. The present study proposes a new, less restrictive method (BF2), that uses a sensor array under a hemispherical dome to overcome the sky condition restrictions of the Overcast method, and tests it against the Overcast and HIA techniques. The study also evaluates the method's ability to predict seedling growth and morphology. The BF2 method provided rapid and precise estimations of %PAR under variable sky conditions, as well as good estimations of seedling's responses, and is suitable for multiple site or highly replicated designs. The methods were used under deciduous stands with contrasting structures. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {We tested to what extent differences in construction costs (CC) and chemical composition of woody species are attributed to leaf habit. Eight evergreen and eight deciduous species belonging to six families were selected to form eight phylogenetic independent contrasts (PICs). The plants were grown from seed in a glasshouse. Differences in leaf, stem and root CC between evergreen and deciduous species were minor, the proportion of variance explained by leaf habit generally being less than 6%. Surprisingly, differences in leaf chemical composition between deciduous and evergreen species were small as well. Variation in CC and chemical composition among families was substantial, the factor 'family' explaining 50-85% of variance. We therefore conclude that in this case, phylogeny is a more important factor than functional group. Leaves of the fast-growing species in this experiment showed high levels of minerals, organic acids, proteins and lipids, whereas leaves of the slow-growing species had higher concentrations of soluble phenolics, lignin as well as higher carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio. These relationships suggest a trade-off between growth and defence. In contrast, CC of leaves, stems, roots or whole plants showed no or only a weak correlation with relative growth rate (RGR). The C/N ratio of the leaves is an easily measured parameter that correlated strongly in a negative way with the RGR of the plants and reflected better the balance between investment in structure and physiological functioning than CC.},

   abstract = {We evaluated leaf characteristics and herbivory intensities for saplings of fifteen tropical tree species differing in their successional position. Eight leaf traits were selected, related to the costs of leaf display (specific leaf area [SLA], water content), photosynthesis (N and P concentration per unit mass), and herbivory defence (lignin concentration, C:N ratio). We hypothesised that species traits are shaped by variation in abiotic and biotic (herbivory) selection pressures along the successional gradient. All leaf traits varied with the successional position of the species. The SLA, water content and nutrient concentration decreased, and lignin concentration increased with the successional position. Herbivory damage (defined as the percentage of damage found at one moment in time) varied from 0.9-8.5% among the species, but was not related to their successional position. Herbivory damage appeared to be a poor estimator of the herbivory rate experienced by species, due to the confounding effect of leaf lifespan. Herbivory rate (defined as percentage leaf area removal per unit time) declined with the successional position of the species. Herbivory rate was only positively correlated to water content, and negatively correlated to lignin concentration, suggesting that herbivores select leaves based upon their digestibility rather than upon their nutritive value. Surprisingly, most species traits change linearly with succession, while resource availability (light, nutrients) declines exponentially with succession.},

   abstract = {Plant growth and defence are both fuelled by compounds synthesized from a common pool of carbon and nitrogen, implying the existence of a competition for carbon and nitrogen allocation to both metabolisms. The ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C:N) of an organ is often regarded as a convenient indicator of growth and quality. The purpose of this work was to assess whether or not it is possible to extend its use to characterize the trade-off between growth and defence processes. Therefore, we calculated C:N ratios in the pool of resources and in the total plant, and correlated them to the concentrations of diverse compounds of the primary and secondary metabolisms in young tomatoes. Plants were grown hydroponically at N availabilities either limiting (0.1 mM) or not (7 mM) for growth in two glasshouses maintained either under ambient or enriched (700 vpm) air CO2. These conditions yielded a large array of C:N in fully developed leaves, developing leaves, stem and roots, sampled 27, 35 and 47 days after sowing. Growth parameters and tissue concentrations of primary metabolites (carbohydrates, starch), defence-related compounds (polyphenols, glycoalkaloids), lignin, nitrate, ammonium, C and N were analyzed. Net CO 2 exchange rate was also measured at the last sampling date. Low N limited plant growth more than photosynthesis. The C:N in the resource pool was far higher than the total C:N. Starch was the most responsive compound, attaining high concentration under high C:N, whereas lignin remained stable. Chlorogenic acid, rutin, kaempferol-rutinoside and tomatine concentrations correlated positively to C:N. The same patterns were observed for most organs and molecules, except soluble carbohydrates in fully developed leaves whose concentration was not influenced. Among the organs, developing leaves showed the highest concentrations of secondary compounds and were the most responsive to C:N variations. Neither the biochemical nature of the compounds (C-based or N- containing metabolites) nor the calculation mode of C:N, influenced the patterns observed. Within the range of N availabilities considered (up to N limitation but not deficiency), the C:N can be considered as a good indicator of the secondary compounds concentrations in organs, especially for those involved in the chemical defence. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Plant domestication is accompanied by shifts in resource allocation, as a result of farmer selection for genotypes that give high yields in agricultural habitats. Relaxed natural selection for chemical and physical defences in these habitats could facilitate resource allocation to yield. We compared the concentrations of tannins, and C/N ratios, which are often correlated with investment in cell-wall compounds, in leaves of landraces of domesticated cassava (Manihot esculenta) and a close wild relative in French Guiana. Foliar concentrations of tannins were about 1.9 times higher in the wild relative than in domesticated cassava. Histochemical analyses showed that tannins were present in nearly all palisade and spongy parenchyma cells of the wild taxon, but in only some cells of these tissues in M. esculenta. C/N ratios were also 1.9 times higher in leaves of the wild relative than in those of domesticated cassava. Tannins accounted for only a small proportion of total carbon, and the higher C/N ratio in wild than in domesticated cassava may reflect higher investment in carbon-containing compounds additional to tannins, such as cell-wall compounds. The divergence in these traits between cassava and this close wild relative mirrors a broad pattern observed in wild plant species across habitats varying in resource availability. One explanation for our results is that domestication in cassava may have favoured a shift from a resource conservation strategy to a resource acquisition strategy. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

   abstract = {Given that a plant's defensive strategy against herbivory is never likely to be a single trait, we develop the concept of plant defense syndromes, where association with specific ecological interactions can result in convergence on suites of covarying defensive traits. Defense syndromes can be studied within communities of diverse plant species as well as within clades of closely related species. In either case, theory predicts that plant defense traits can consistently covary across species, due to shared evolutionary ancestry or due to adaptive convergence. We examined potential defense syndromes in 24 species of milkweeds (Asclepias spp.) in a field experiment. Employing phylogenetically independent contrasts, we found few correlations between seven defensive traits, no bivariate trade-offs, and notable positive correlations between trichome density and latex production, and between C:N ratio and leaf toughness. We then used a hierarchical cluster analysis to produce a phenogram of defense trait similarity among the 24 species. This analysis revealed three distinct clusters of species. The defense syndromes of these species clusters are associated with either low nutritional quality or a balance of higher nutritional quality coupled with physical or chemical defenses. The phenogram based on defense traits was not congruent, however, with a molecular phylogeny of the group, suggesting convergence on defense syndromes. Finally, we examined the performance of monarch butterfly caterpillars on the 24 milkweed species in the field; monarch growth and survival did not differ on plants in the three syndromes, although multiple regression revealed that leaf trichomes and toughness significantly reduced caterpillar growth. The discovery of convergent plant defense syndromes can be used as a framework to ask questions about how abiotic environments, communities of herbivores, and biogeography are associated with particular defense strategies of plants.},

   abstract = {Plant defense theories predict that allocation to antiherbivore defenses should impose a cost on plants, manifested as a reduction in growth and reproduction. However, the empirical evidence for the existence of such trade-offs is conflicting, suggesting that significant fitness costs of defense arise in some circumstances but not in others. A meta- analysis of 70 studies assessing the relationship between measures of plant defense and growth or reproduction has been conducted to examine the relative importance of several potential sources of variation in the fitness costs of defense. The magnitude of fitness costs varied depending on whether they were measured at the level of phenotype or genotype. The mean magnitude of among-genotype correlations (AGCs) between defense and fitness measures (r � �0.30) was higher than that of among-phenotype correlations (APCs; r � �0.15). Moreover, AGCs tended to be more negative when defense was assessed as the inverse of herbivore densities or damage rather than in terms of single specific chemical or structural traits. The magnitude of APCs was greatly influenced by environmental var- iation; phenotypic costs were lowest under controlled experimental conditions and highest in studies that minimized genetic variation among plants. In addition, the magnitude and sign of APCs varied depending on nutrient availability and the type of defensive compound. APCs were negative at high levels of nutrient availability and for defenses associated with alkaloids and phenolics but tended to be positive at low levels of nutrient availability and for defenses associated with terpenoids. In contrast, the magnitude of fitness costs was not significantly affected by the presence of herbivores, type of plant, type of defense (con- stitutive, mechanical, or induced), concentrations of defensive compounds, or measure of plant fitness. The above patterns of variation in the magnitude of correlations between defense and fitness measures are inconsistent with the notion that fitness costs are incurred through diversion of common limited resources from growth and reproduction to defense (allocation costs). Instead, the prevalence of significant negative correlations under uncon- trolled environmental conditions and their persistence in the presence of herbivores both imply that fitness costs of defense may often arise through interactions between plants and their abiotic and biotic environment (competitors, pollinators, different types of herbivores, their natural enemies, and various types of abiotic stresses). Because the above aspects have usually been excluded in studies aiming at detecting internal allocation trade-offs, the failure to detect costs in some cases may be a consequence of the experimental design. Future studies should examine the relative importance of opportunity and ecological types of costs by manipulating various aspects of plant environment.},

Four seed traps were placed beneath the crowns of the same trees at the north, south, east, and west positions to determine acorn weight and number on a fortnightly basis during the mast seeding period (October to January). The accuracy of the visual survey was assessed by linear regression and correlation analysis. The results indicated a significant positive correlation of the two methods during all the three time periods. The resulting regression equations allowed estimation of acorn production based on visual surveys.

Crude protein levels of Rubus sp., Robinia pseudacacia L., Castanea sativa Miller, and grasses could meet deer nitrogen requirements but their low IVOMD and high fiber percentages make them mid-low feed value forages. Understory layer of oakwoods provides higher quality forage than conifer or eucalyptus stands. Crude protein and digestibility of plants peaked in spring-summer and the highest fiber content occurred in winter. Seasonal fluctuations in forage quality makes seasonal management and seasonal plans neccesary.},

There are two parametrization for the presented model, one using the common Dirichlet distribution's alpha parameters, and a reparametrization of the alpha's to set up a mean-and-dispersion-like model. By applying appropriate link-functions, a GLM-like framework is set up that allows for the analysis of such data in a straightforward and familiar way, because interpretation is similar to multinomial logistic regression. This paper gives a brief theoretical foundation and describes the implementation as well as application (including worked examples) of Dirichlet regression methods implemented in the package DirichletReg (Maier, 2013) in the R language (R Core Team, 2013).

Apart from the fact that generalized linear models are better suited in dealing with count data, a log-transformation of counts has the additional quandary in how to deal with zero observations. With just one zero observation (if this observation represents a sampling unit), the whole data set needs to be fudged by adding a value (usually 1) before transformation. 3. Simulating data from a negative binomial distribution, we compared the outcome of fitting models that were transformed in various ways (log, square root) with results from fitting models using quasi-Poisson and negative binomial models to untransformed count data. 4. We found that the transformations performed poorly, except when the dispersion was small and the mean counts were large. The quasi-Poisson and negative binomial models consistently performed well, with little bias. 5. We recommend that count data should not be analysed by log-transforming it, but instead models based on Poisson and negative binomial distributions should be used.},

   abstract = {For many years, browsing wild ungulates have been considered the major cause for the decline of silver fir (Abies alba) in Europe. To better understand the dynamics of silver fir-beech forests hosting important deer populations, we studied forest renewal using a synchronistic approach, i.e. by comparing similar stands of different ages. Regeneration in a series of forests, where seedlings (<150 cm) were submitted to an increasing browsing pressure, was examined initially. We then analysed young stands (>2 m), which have grown in similar ecological conditions and also under increasing browsing. Published results on regeneration have identified three key factors as modulators of the effects of deer browsing on the composition of regeneration: understory abundance, stand composition and orientation to sun. This paper deals with the second part of the study. It examines the influence, over time, of the three environmental characteristics, identified at regeneration stage, by analysing the composition and the structure of young stands grown under comparable conditions. A total of 152 plots of 150 m2 each were selected, spread over 30 km2 of an ancient game reserve and core analysis was used to identify whether trees were under 150 cm when browsing became noticeable. Our results confirmed the critical role of stand composition, orientation to sun and understory - the latter being far predominant. Indeed, previous stand composition (i.e. seed trees at the time of regeneration) and orientation to sun did not explain current young stand composition alone, but when a south-exposed slope was previously occupied by mature spruce, then young spruce trees were frequent. Understory clearly played a positive role in the conservation of fir, despite increased browsing by deer. In fact, fir was abundant in the young stands when understory above seedlings was important at the time of regeneration, but when understory was poor, spruce became the dominant species and fir was seldom observed. Overall, silver fir was often the dominant species among young stands, despite a progressive increase in spruce numbers. The dominance of fir may be explained by the particular sylvicultural history of the studied forests. However, in the future, the expansion of spruce, favoured by deer foraging on fir and by even-aged sylviculture, may lead to localized failure of fir regeneration. To promote silver fir-beech forest renewal, forestry practices should change towards a system more closely resembling natural forest dynamics. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Forest management consists in anthropogenic disturbances that are able to modulate ecological features, resource availability and successional patterns. Plant communities are thus expected to react differently to contrasted silvicultural systems. We compared plant species composition between stands submitted to a traditional management since many centuries (i.e. coppice-with-standards treatment, stands intensively but infrequently disturbed) and stands recently converted into a selective cutting system (stands moderately but frequently disturbed), over uniform edaphic and topographic conditions. We found significant differences in species composition between both systems. Despite a strong shift in species composition among different stages of the coppice cycle, coppice-with-standards stands supported the highest number of true forest species. Selectively-cut stands were more homogeneous and characterized by ruderal "generalist" species. These fast changes in vegetation composition were related to differences in a group of factors that are directly or indirectly linked to the silviculture-associated disturbance regime, including soil moisture, soil fertility, forest microclimate, light and game predation. We conclude that the conversion of a silvicultural system which has patterned plant communities since many centuries, induces early major changes in vegetation composition. The most negatively impacted species are the so-called "true forest species" that may be better labelled "coppice-woodland species". © INRA, EDP Sciences, 2005.},

The antioxidant parameters analysed were: α- and γ-tocopherol, total phenolics compounds (TPC), lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidant activities (LAA, HAA) (acorn and grass) and condensed and hydrolysable tannins (CT, HT) and protein precipitating capacity (PP) (acorns). To characterise the fatty acid profiles, the thirteen major fatty acids were assayed. For the acorns, it was found that there was intra-annual variability in all the antioxidants studied except α-tocopherol, and inter-annual variability in all except the protein precipitating capacity. The fatty acid profile also varied depending on the sampling date and the study year, especially in the saturated fatty acids (SFA) and C18:1 n-9 content. For the grass, there was intra- and inter-annual variability in all the antioxidant parameters studied, and in the proportions of the fatty acids C18:0, and C18:1. It could explain variations in the antioxidant and fatty acids composition of Iberian pig tissues from animals raised in different " montanera" seasons and even in the same " montanera" season. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Scientists, wild deer managers, domestic deer farmers, veterinarians, venison and antler product producers, and others were able to discuss common problems and to share their knowledge and experience. The relationships formed at that meeting, and the information amassed in the resulting Proceedings, sparked new endeavors in cervid research, management, and production. A great deal has taken place in the world of deer biology since 1983. Wild deer populations, although ever increasing in many areas of the world, face new hazards of habitat loss, environmental contamination, and overexploitation. Some species are closer to extinction than ever. Game managers often face political as well as biological challenges. Many more deer are now on farms, leading to greater concerns about disease control and increased needs for husbandry information.

   abstract = {1 In terrestrial ecosystems many species show large population fluctuations caused by pulsed resources, such as mast seeding. A prime example of a mammal strongly affected by mast seeding of trees is the wild boar Sus scrofa, a species that has become a pest in many parts of the world. We investigated the population dynamics of wild boar to assist the development of effective management strategies for this species and possibly for other pulsed resource consumers. 2 We analysed published vital rates of wild boar using Leslie matrix projection models and elasticity analysis. Models were based on vital rates of animals under poor, intermediate and good environmental conditions, which represent combinations of differences in food availability (particularly mast of beech Fagus sylvatica and/or oak Quercus spp.) and winter climate. 3 Interestingly, we observed a crossover in the ranking of elasticities (e; the relative impact of each vital rate on population growth rate λ) when comparing different conditions. While the elasticity of λ to adult survival was highest in poor environments [e(Padult) = 0·36, e(Pjuvenile) = 0·22], the elasticity of λ to juvenile survival was highest under good conditions [e(Padult) = 0·16, e(Pjuvenile) = 0·28]. Thus juvenile survival becomes increasingly important for population growth as habitat conditions improve. 4 Our analysis of empirical beech mast records gave some indication of an increase of full masts over the last few decades. Modelling different beech mast scenarios showed that an increase in full mast frequency will lead to a rapid increase in λ. The availability of alternative food resources, namely agricultural crops, may also contribute to an expansion of wild boar populations. 5 Synthesis and applications. We suggest that, whenever possible, management strategies should be based on separate elasticity analyses for different environmental conditions, especially for species dependent on pulsed resources. For wild boar we suggest the following principal management strategies to stop further population increases: (i) supplementary feeding should be strictly avoided; (ii) under good environmental conditions, reducing juvenile survival will have the largest effect on λ, whereas strong hunting pressure on adult females will lead to most effective population control in years with poor conditions.},

The proposed model is useful for situations where the variable of interest is continuous and restricted to the interval (0, 1) and is related to other variables through a regression structure. The regression parameters of the beta regression model are interpretable in terms of the mean of the response and, when the logit link is used, of an odds ratio, unlike the parameters of a linear regression that employs a transformed response. Estimation is performed by maximum likelihood. We provide closed-form expressions for the score function, for Fisher's information matrix and its inverse. Hypothesis testing is performed using approximations obtained from the asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator. Some diagnostic measures are introduced. Finally, practical applications that employ real data are presented and discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

This article presents an 8 km resolution atmospheric reanalysis over France performed with the the Safran gauge-based analysis system for the period 1958-2008. Climatological features of the Safran 50-year analysis—long-term mean values, interannual and seasonal variability—are first presented for all computed variables: rainfall, snowfall, mean air temperature, specific humidity, wind speed, solar and infrared radiation. The spatial patterns of precipitation, minimum and maximum temperature are compared to another spatialisation method, and the temporal consistency of the reanalysis is assessed through various validation experiments with both dependent and independent data. These experiments demonstrate the overall robustness of the Safran reanalysis and the improvement of its quality with time, in connection with the sharp increase in the observation network density that occurred in the 1990s. They also show the differentiated sensitivity of variables to the number of available ground observations, with precipitation and air temperature being the more robust ones. The comparison of trends from the reanalysis with those from homogenized series finally shows that if spatial patterns are globally consistent with both approaches, care must be taken when using literal values from the reanalysis and corresponding statistical significance in climate change detection studies. The Safran 50-year atmospheric reanalysis constitutes a long-term forcing datasets for land surface schemes and will thus enable simulating the past 50 years of water resources over France.},

   abstract = {© 2018 The Author(s) Variation in seed availability shapes plant communities, and is strongly affected by seed predation. In some plant species, temporal variation in seed production is especially high and synchronized over large areas, which is called ‘mast seeding’. One selective advantage of this phenomenon is predator satiation which posits that masting helps plants escape seed predation through starvation of predators in lean years, and satiation in mast years. However, even though seed predation can be predicted to have a strong spatial component and depend on plant densities, whether the effectiveness of predator satiation in masting plants changes according to the Janzen-Connell effect has been barely investigated. We studied, over an 8-year period, the seed production, the spatiotemporal patters of weevil seed predation, and the abundance of adult weevils in a holm oak (Quercus ilex) population that consists of trees interspersed at patches covering a continuum of conspecific density. Isolated oaks effectively satiate predators, but this is trumped by increasing conspecific plant density. Lack of predator satiation in trees growing in dense patches was caused by re-distribution of insects among plants that likely attenuated them against food shortage in lean years, and changed the type of weevil functional response from type II in isolated trees to type III in trees growing in dense patches. This study provides the first empirical evaluation of the notion that masting and predator satiation should be more important in populations that start to dominate their communities, and is consistent with the observation that masting is less frequent and less intense in diverse forests.},

   abstract = {Many plant species are thought to benefit from mast seeding as a result of increased seed survival through predator satiation. However, in communities with many different masting species, lack of synchrony in seed production among species may decrease seed survival by maintaining seed predator populations through the inter-mast cycle. Similarly, masting by different plant species may have different effects on the seed predator community. We conducted a three-year study in a northeastern USA temperate deciduous forest to determine if production of large seed crops by several tree species was synchronous, and if they had similar effects on all small mammal species. We found that red oak mast crops resulted in increased densities of Peromyscus leucopus and P. maniculatus, but had no effect on Clethrionomys gapperi abundance. Conversely, C. gapperi populations, but not Peromyscus populations, appeared to increase in response to a large red maple seed crop. Differences in small mammal abundance resulted in changes in species-specific seed survival: in the year of abundant C. gapperi, experimentally placed red oak acorns had significantly higher survival than in the year of high Peromyscus abundance. Red oak acorn removal was positively correlated with Peromyscus abundance, while red maple seed removal was significantly higher with increased C. gapperi abundance. Thus, species-specific seed production had differential effects on subsequent small mammal abundance, which in turn affected seed survival. We suggest that at the level of the community, even short-term lack of synchrony in production of large seed crops can cause variation in postdispersal seed survival, through differential effects on the community of small mammal seed predators.},

We investigated the effect of population density and climatic conditions on cohort performance. We predicted that: (1) body mass of growing fawns should be sensitive to environmental changes, showing marked between-year variation (i.e., cohort effects), (2) fawns in the less productive (weakly seasonal, weakly predictable summer weather) habitat of Chizé should show stronger density-dependent responses due to more severe food competition during summer than fawns in the more productive (markedly seasonal, moderately predictable summer weather) habitat of Bogesund, and (3) fawns at Bogesund should be heavier both in absolute terms and relative to their size than their conspecifics in Chizé due to a higher degree of fat accumulation in northern environments. In both study sites we found marked cohort variation and clear effects of density, with body mass varying by as much as 29% over years. While neither summer nor winter climate influenced fawn body mass at Bogesund, fawns tended to be lighter after summers with high temperatures at Chizé. In addition, fawns were heavier after acorn mast years experienced in utero at Bogesund. As expected, the strength of the density-dependent response of fawn body mass was greater at Chizé than at Bogesund. For a given density, male fawns were consistently heavier than females in both sites. Lastly, both sexes at Bogesund had higher absolute body mass and were larger for a given body size than in Chizé. Our results clearly demonstrate that absolute density is a poor predictor of roe deer performance and supports the view that habitat quality has an overwhelming importance for determining fawn body mass in roe deer populations.},

   abstract = {Forest fragmentation may benefit generalist herbivores by increasing access to various substitutable food resources, with potential consequences for their population dynamics. We studied a European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) population living in an agricultural mosaic of forest, woodlots, meadows and cultivated crops. We tested whether diet composition and quality varied spatially across the landscape using botanical analyses of rumen contents and chemical analyses of the plants consumed in relation to landscape metrics. In summer and non-mast winters, roe deer ate more cultivated seeds and less native forest browse with increasing availability of crops in the local landscape. This spatial variation resulted in contrasting diet quality, with more cell content and lower lignin and hemicellulose content (high quality) for individuals living in more open habitats. The pattern was less marked in the other seasons when diet composition, but not diet quality, was only weakly related to landscape structure. In mast autumns and winters, the consumption of acorns across the entire landscape resulted in a low level of differentiation in diet composition and quality. Our results reflect the ability of generalist species, such as roe deer, to adapt to the fragmentation of their forest habitat by exhibiting a plastic feeding behavior, enabling them to use supplementary resources available in the agricultural matrix. This flexibility confers nutritional advantages to individuals with access to cultivated fields when their native food resources are depleted or decline in quality (e. g. during non-mast years) and may explain local heterogeneities in individual phenotypic quality. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

   abstract = {Irruptive migrants are partially migrating species showing pronounced temporal variation in the number of migrants. Occasional irruptions are often explained by increased population density (per area) or lack of food. Similarly to population dynamics, these explanations are not mutually exclusive, but probably act in concert. Here we do a parallel analysis on the migration intensity and population dynamics of an irruptive migratory bird species, the great spotted woodpecker Dendrocopos major, in southern Finland. Both analyses include simultaneous effects of breeding density and cone crops of Scots pine Pinus sylvestris and Norway spruce Picea abies. A novel model for statistical analyses of irruptive migration intensity is developed. Population dynamics are investigated using log-linear state-space models. Woodpecker migration intensity is well explained by lack of spruce cones and increases proportionally to population density. Population dynamics is most successfully described with a density dependent model, where the natural logarithm of spruce cone availability previous autumn has a strong positive effect on population growth. This is likely to be due to lowered winter mortality and lowered emigration rates resulting from plentiful food availability. Although the species uses pine cones as a food resource in winter, the estimated impacts of pine cone crops on migration intensity and population dynamics are low, probably due to low annual variation in crop comparing to spruce cones. Large irruptions also tend to occur earlier in season, often before cones are a crucial food resource for the woodpeckers, suggesting that the woodpeckers use the amount of maturing cones as a cue for upcoming conditions. Our results show that the ecological role of different resources can differ considerably from the expected pattern based on the proportion of the resources in a species' diet. Advantages of examining patterns of bird migration, population density and dynamics in unison are apparent.},

   abstract = {We estimated the seed shadow created by the Asiatic black bear Ursus thibetanus in order to evaluate the bears effectiveness as a seed disperser. We combined data from bear movements, determined by GPS telemetry, with data from gut retention time (GRT). We estimated plant seed shadows in two ways: from direct movement data to give the actual seed shadow (ASS), and from cumulative movement data to give the potential seed shadow (PSS). The purpose of this study was to answer the following questions: (1) does GRT differ between seasons or in the size of contents? (2) Does seed shadow vary among sex, seasons, estimation method (ASS or PSS), and years? (3) Does the masting affect seed shadows? There were no differences in median GRT among seasons or seed dimensions. Combining these data, the seed shadows produced by long GRT (median; 15.2-19.7 hours, maximum; 44.0 hours) and large daily movements suggest that the bears effectively move 40% of the seeds they consume to a distance greater than 500 m from the parent tree and can potentially move the seeds up to a maximum distance of more than 22 000 m from the parent tree. The results also indicate that bears make complex seed shadows caused by multiple defecations and long periods of daily movement. In summary, PSS did not differ between sexes, but PSS can be expected to be larger in autumn than in summer of each year. ASS, however, can be expected to be larger in males than females, and to be larger in autumn than in summer. ASS may become especially large during a poor masting year as compared to good masting years. These results indicate that bears are potentially more effective seed dispersers during years of poor fruit production in autumn. The bears have longer seed shadows than other seed disperser and consequently may play a unique role in the maintenance and renewal of forest ecosystem. © 2011 The Authors.},

Three primary bear foods, cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki), whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) nuts, and elk (Cervus elaphus), have declined in recent years. Because park managers and the public are concerned about the impact created by reductions in these foods, we quantified bear diets to determine how bears living near Yellowstone Lake are adjusting. We estimated diets using: 1) stable isotope andmercury analyses of hair samples collected from captured bears and from hair collection sites established along cutthroat trout spawning streams and 2) visits to recent locations occupied by bears wearing Global Positioning System collars to identify signs of feeding behavior and to collect scats for macroscopic identification of residues. Approximately 45  22% (x  SD) of the assimilated nitrogen consumed by male grizzly bears, 38  20% by female grizzly bears, and 23  7% by male and female black bears came from animal matter. These assimilated dietary proportions for female grizzly bears were the same as 10 years earlier in the Lake area and 30 years earlier in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. However, the proportion ofmeat in the assimilated diet of male grizzly bears decreased over both time frames. The estimated biomass of cutthroat trout consumed by grizzly bears and black bears declined 70% and 95%, respectively, in the decade between 1997–2000 and 2007–2009. Grizzly bears killed an elk calf every 4.3  2.7 days and black bears every 8.0  4.0 days during June. Elk accounted for 84% of all ungulates consumed by both bear species. Whitebark pine nuts continue to be a primary food source for both grizzly bears and black bears when abundant, but are replaced by false-truffles (Rhizopogon spp.) in the diets of female grizzly bears and black bears when nut crops are minimal. Thus, both grizzly bears and black bears continue to adjust to changing resources, with larger grizzly bears continuing to occupy a more carnivorous niche than the smaller, more herbivorous black bear.},

Scat analyses revealed seasonal changes in the diet of bears; the dominant food items were forbs with small numbers of ants in early summer, crops in late summer, and berries and Q. crispula acorns in autumn. Acorn production fluctuated annually throughout the study and was highest in 1994 and lowest in 1995. From September through November 1995, the frequency of occurrence of acorns was lower, and that of crops was higher, than in the other years. We found a negative correlation between the difference in the same month of the previous year in percent volume of crops in the diet and that in acorn production in September through October, 1994-1997. In years of low acorn production, brown bears used crops as an alternative food source from September through November, although there was no significant difference in August.},

   abstract = {Forest gap models, initially conceived in 1969 as a special case of individual-tree based models, have become widely popular among forest ecologists for addressing a large number of applied research questions, including the impacts of global change on long-term dynamics of forest structure, biomass, and composition. However, they have been strongly criticized for a number of weaknesses inherent in the original model structure. In this paper, I review the fundamental assumptions underlying forest gap models, the structure of the parent model JABOWA, and examine these criticisms in the context of the many alternative formulations that have been developed over the past 30 years. Four assumptions originally underlie gap models: (1) The forest is abstracted as a composite of many small patches of land, where each can have a different age and successional stage; (2) patches are horizontally homogeneous, i.e., tree position within a patch is not considered; (3) the leaves of each tree are located in an indefinitely thin layer (disk) at the top of the stem; and (4) successional processes are described on each patch separately, i.e., there are no interactions between patches. These simplifications made it possible to consider mixed-species, mixed-age forests, which had been difficult previously mainly because of computing limitations. The structure of JABOWA is analysed in terms of the functional relationships used for formulating the processes of tree establishment, growth, and mortality. It is concluded that JABOWA contains a number of unrealistic assumptions that have not been questioned strongly to date. At the same time, some aspects of JABOWA that were criticized strongly in the past years are internally consistent given the objectives of this specific model. A wide variety of formulations for growth processes, establishment, and mortality factors have been developed in gap models over the past 30 years, and modern gap models include more robust parameterizations of environmental influences on tree growth and population dynamics as compared to JABOWA. Approaches taken in more recent models that led to the relaxation of one or several of the four basic assumptions are discussed. It is found that the original assumptions often have been replaced by alternatives; however, no systematic analysis of the behavioral effects of these conceptual changes has been attempted to date. The feasibility of including more physiological detail (instead of using relatively simple parameterizations) in forest gap models is discussed, and it is concluded that we often lack the data base to implement such approaches for more than a few commercially important tree species. Hence, it is important to find a compromise between using simplistic parameterizations and expanding gap models with physiology-based functions and parameters that are difficult to estimate. While the modeling of tree growth has received a lot of attention over the past years, much less effort has been spent on improving the formulations of tree establishment and mortality, although these processes are likely to be just as sensitive to global change as tree growth itself. Finally, model validation issues are discussed, and it is found that there is no single data source that can reliably be used for evaluating the behavior of forest gap models; instead, I propose a combination of sensitivity analyses, qualitative examinations of process formulations, and quantitative tests of gap models or selected submodels against various kinds of empirical data to evaluate the usefulness of these models for assessing their utility for predicting the impacts of global change on long-term forest dynamics.},

   abstract = {Diet selection by mammalian herbivores is often influenced by plant community composition, and numerous studies have focused on the relationships between herbivore foraging decisions and food/plant species abundance. However, few have examined the role of neighbour palatability in affecting foraging of a target plant by large mammalian herbivores. We used a large-scale field dataset on diet selection by red deer Cervus elaphus in Fiordland National Park, New Zealand to: (1) estimate the palatability of native forest plant species to introduced deer from observed patterns of browse damage; and (2) examine whether intraspecific variation in browsing of plants can be related to variation in the local abundance of alternative forage species. Overall, 21 of the 53 forest species in our dataset were never browsed by deer. At a community level, plants were more likely to be browsed if they were in a patch of vegetation of high forage quality, containing high abundances of highly palatable species and/or low abundances of less-palatable species. Our findings suggest that deer make foraging decisions at both a coarse-grain level, selecting vegetation patches within a landscape based on the overall patch quality, and at a fine-grain level by choosing among individual plants of different species. © 2008 The Authors.},

   abstract = {Herbivores contend with spatial and temporal variation in the quality, quantity, and availability of their food resource. The energy that female moose (Alces alces) store during the summer as body fat is used to meet energy needs in winter. The foraging strategy used by an animal affects its daily and annual energy balance. Consequently, foraging strategies and the distribution of food in the landscape can affect individual fitness and population growth through their effects on the energy balance of reproductive females. Models that unify landscape structure, foraging theory, and animal energy metabolism can be used to investigate the effects of foraging strategies on survival and reproduction. We developed an energy and activity simulation environment (EASE) model that predicts the seasonal changes in energy requirements of a female moose foraging in a spatially explicit landscape with a resolution of 1 m2. We validated EASE for both moose and deer (Odocoileus spp.) with respect to body mass changes reported for feeding trials, activity times, and browse intake rates. Energy intake and body mass depended on forage abundance, its spatial distribution, and foraging strategy. In simulations with stochasticity imposed on model parameters, mean moose body mass decreased 4 kg in comparison to simulations that were deterministic. Simulated moose body mass was most sensitive to browse digestibility and least sensitive to maximum intake per day in 1-yr simulations. Moose using nonrandom foraging strategies had higher body mass and survival than moose using random foraging strategies. Differences between strategies increased as browse density decreased. Moose that selected foraging locations with higher food density or food items with higher digestibility deposited more fat and protein than less selective moose, leading to increased survival and reproduction.},

   abstract = {Ungulate browsing affects many plant species, shifting patterns of relative abundance, plant community diversity, and ecosystem processes. Despite the strength and diversity of ungulate impacts, we lack comprehensive methods and a unified network for tracking and comparing ungulate impacts across the Great Lakes region. The Great Lakes Network Office (GLN) of the National Park Service has identified white-tailed deer as a keystone herbivore that could threaten the health of Great Lakes forests. To supplement their permanent vegetation monitoring program, GLN monitors deer and moose browsing pressure on woody and herbaceous plants at nine national parks in the region. We used data from these surveys to investigate relationships among patterns of browsing across species and sites with the goal of inferring efficient and reliable indicators of ungulate impacts. We also investigated the relationships between patterns of browsing on woody vegetation and among-site variation in the presence and abundance of understory species. Our results showed that ungulates clearly prefer certain woody species, but these vary across the region in response to local community composition. Ungulate impacts on understory species are correlated with woody browsing impacts but also vary with local ecological conditions. To build a more efficient and accurate composite indicator of overall ungulate impacts, we combined data on woody plant browsing with data on the abundance of specific understory species to infer overall levels of threat from ungulate browsing. Such combined indicators improve our ability to monitor the impacts of ungulate browsing, particularly if such methods can be expanded and standardized across the region. © 2012 .},

While several studies have looked for quantifying this impact in terms of plant biomass, plant survival or financial costs, the potential benefit of using the response of the vegetation to changes in browsing pressure by large herbivores to monitor their populations has been poorly investigated. As getting accurate estimates of density in populations of large herbivores is problematic, the use of indicators measuring the intensity of browsing might offer reliable alternative to managers. From the intensive monitoring of a roe deer population subject to an experimental manipulation of density, we looked for assessing the response of oak to changes of roe deer population size. Using a simple browsing index calculated from field data over 10 years, we found that this oak browsing index linearly increased with increasing population size of roe deer. This suggests that such an oak browsing index might be a reliable "indicator of ecological change" for monitoring roe deer populations in oak forests with natural regeneration. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

   abstract = {Key message: Thanks to the concomitant recordings of vegetation and deer browsing sampled first in 1976, then resurveyed in 2006, we show that forest plant communities shifted in response to deer population dynamics, stand management and eutrophication. Context and aims: High deer populations alter forest understory dynamics worldwide. However, no study ever attempted to rank the importance of deer herbivory relatively to other environmental drivers. In the Arc-en-Barrois National Forest (France), we investigated whether (i) deer browsing is a critical driver of vegetation composition and dynamics, (ii) the vegetation communities recover after a decrease in deer populations. Methods: In 2006, we resurveyed 321 plots from a network of 1027 plots where vegetation composition and browsing pressure was first assessed in 1976. We used coinertia analysis to identify the gradients in vegetation composition in 1976, when abiotic variables were also recorded. We assessed shifts in plant community composition using mean Ellenberg indicator values, analysed plot scores shifts along the axes of the coinertia analysis and correlated these shifts with changes in browsing pressure. Results: Two major gradients determined vegetation composition in 1976: edaphic variables (nitrogen availability and soil moisture) and browsing pressure. Over the next 30 years, we noticed a strong increase in nitrophilous plant species frequency and community composition shifted towards lightly browsed characteristics, accompanying a decrease in browsing pressure. Shifts in community composition were significantly correlated with the intensity of changes in browsing pressure, showing that deer population dynamics were a determinant driver of changes in plant assemblages. Conclusion: Our results provide evidence for a structuring effect of deer browsing on vegetation composition, once forest site variations (soil moisture and nitrogen) were accounted for. We observed an incomplete recovery of the communities 25 years after the reduction of deer densities, suggesting a delayed response to deer population reduction. Long-term monitoring of forest biodiversity should therefore include browsing pressure assessment to control for potential effects of wild ungulates.},

   abstract = {Innovative agricultural systems need to combine the production of goods with the provision of environmental services. When agronomists analyse or design multifunctional agro-ecosystems, they thus need to include knowledge of an increasing range of scientific disciplines (plant biology, soil science, ecology, etc.) while continuing to use their systemic approach as a cornerstone. Increasing amounts of knowledge of different types (concepts and data) will thus have to be included in systemic approaches that are developed in the agronomic domain. Knowledge integration and sharing are frequently hampered by the lack of detail in the assumptions made in each discipline. We hypothesise that a standardised description of the conceptual model underlying data collection and the analysis of agro ecosystems would improve transparency and knowledge integration.Here we propose a protocol to formalise the conceptual modelling of an agro-ecosystem (CMA) related to a specific agronomic issue. The CMA protocol is implemented in four iterative steps: (i) structural analysis, (ii) functional analysis, (iii) dynamic analysis, and (iv) consistency check. The final product is a conceptual model of an agro-ecosystem whose key elements are a structured knowledge base and associated graphical representations. The protocol was drawn up based on three case studies concerning three different biophysical objects (coffee agroforest, cotton, grapevine) with different problems to be addressed. They are given here as an illustration of how to apply the CMA protocol, and to show how it can be used as a tool to build a systemic representation of a complex agro-ecosystem, as a tool for agronomic diagnosis and yield gap analysis, or as a tool to elicit a range of expert knowledge to design new field experiments.The CMA protocol proved to be efficient in guiding the process of conceptualisation up to the point at which the variables that need to be measured in the field are identified and interlinked. It enabled elicitation and integration of knowledge from different biophysical disciplines and different types of expertise during the conceptualisation process. It also enabled identification of knowledge gaps, and the design and analysis of experiments to tackle complex problems. The CMA yielded by the protocol could be used again, thanks to its transparency and modularity. Further work is underway to improve the CMA representation and its uses in numerical model specification and in participatory methods for the design of cropping systems. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {The abundance and composition of ungulate herbivore communities are changing globally, which can impact the resilience and function of Earth's ecosystems. Impacts from herbivory are compounded in areas where multiple ungulates overlap, which is common in forest ecosystems. The objective of this study was to examine the differential and combined effects of ungulate communities (deer, elk, and cattle) on aspen forest recruitment after fires that occurred in 2012. Eight sets of differential ungulate exclosures, monitored by camera traps, were established across three National Forests in Utah. We identified the differential effect of each of three ungulate species using fencing that allowed for deer-only, native ungulate only (deer and elk), all ungulates and a complete ungulate exclosure. Over a three year period (2013–2016) we quantified ungulate species impacts on aspen height, density, and browse rates using camera trap photos. Ungulate activity was nearly 10-fold higher in two National Forests compared to the third, and gradually decreased over time. Meristem removal by ungulates in unfenced plots across sites averaged 60% which we identified as a critical threshold point for aspen recruitment failure. All three ungulate species had significant and similar effects on aspen regeneration success, but when adjusted for differences in estimated forage intake (animal unit months), differential impacts became apparent (deer > elk > cattle). We estimated that 4 cattle per camera−1 day−1 and 2.5 deer or elk per camera−1 day−1 was sufficient to reach the critical recruitment threshold of 60% removal of apical meristems. We conclude that ungulates species differentially influence aspen regeneration and recruitment, and that ungulate browsing above 30% meristem removal impairs aspen recruitment with recruitment failure occurring above 60% meristem loss.},

   abstract = {Forest ecosystems are shaped by their historical disturbance regime. Structural and species diversity are driven by disturbance frequency, patch size and microsite disturbance severity in forests across the globe. Forest management in Lake State northern hardwoods, however, has primarily used high-frequency, low- to moderate-severity canopy disturbance and low-severity microsite disturbance harvesting techniques such as single-tree selection. Catastrophic disturbances during European settlement followed by the widespread and long-term use of uniform approaches to forest management have homogenized managed forests and created a need to emulate a fuller range of historically prevalent natural disturbances. We present a conceptual model based on complex adaptive forest management that proposes five primary factors including mean patch size, proportion disturbed, frequency, degree of exposed mineral soil and coarse woody debris input. This model demonstrates the need for a greater range of silvicultural systems to more closely emulate the range of variability associated with natural disturbance regimes. In Great Lakes northern hardwoods, using a greater variety of silvicultural systems including those with larger patch cuts and greater soil disturbance, may restore and promote structural and tree species diversity in these forests by creating greater microsite heterogeneity. Applying this conceptual model to forests more broadly, while still considering regionally specific factors, may help restore species and structural diversity and ultimately, ecosystem resilience.},

Model building implies transforming a conceptual model into sets of mathematical equations and then translating these equations into a computer program. Although recent crop modelling frameworks can technically support model building, the modelling process is not always well documented and difficult to repeat. The focus of this paper is therefore on developing and documenting an approach to re-assemble crop models, i.e. develop a new model from an existing one, using a crop modelling framework and crop physiological knowledge. Modifications to an initial crop model were classified according to three categories: (i) changes in parameter values, (ii) changes in equations, and (iii) changes in overall model structure. We illustrate the approach with a case study transforming a wheat crop model into a pea crop model. We discuss the role of each actor in the process to document diverse uncertainties related to the model (i.e. contextual situation, data, structure), and the general applicability of the approach for different crop modelling frameworks. We conclude that the use of our approach to re-assemble a crop model within a modelling framework facilitates integration of different disciplines around a modelling objective, and facilitates creating transparent and reproducible models. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

A generic farm representation and decision diagrams are obtained from cross-case analysis and are modeled with Unified Modeling Language. We applied the methodology to a research question on water management in an emerging country (India). Our methodology bridges the gap between field observations and the design of the decision model.

In this paper we review differences and similarities among different developed frameworks and identify some implications for crop modelling. We consider three modelling frameworks currently used for crop modelling: CROSPAL (CROp Simulator: Picking and Assembling Libraries), APES (Agricultural Production and Externalities Simulator) and APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator). The frameworks are implemented differently and they provide more or less flexibility and guidance, to facilitate assembly of crop model from model components. We underline the importance of systematic approaches to facilitate the selection of appropriate model structure and derive suggestions to facilitate it. We particularly stress the need for better documentation of the underlying assumptions of the modules on simulated processes and on the criteria applied in the selection of these modules for a particular simulation objective. Such documentation should help to point out the sources of uncertainties associated with the development of crop models and to reinforce the role of the crop modeller as an intermediary between the software engineer, coding the modules, and the end users, agronomists or crop physiologists using the model for a specific objective. Finally, the key contributions of modelling frameworks in the crop modelling domain are discussed and we draw conclusions for the prospects of such frameworks in the crop modelling field which should continue to reside on the principles of systems analysis but combined with up-to-date advances in software engineering techniques. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Avoidance and tolerance are the two means by which plants cope with herbivores. Avoidances internal to the plant, such as morphology, chemical repellants, thorns, etc., have received considerable attention in the plant-herbivore literature, but relatively little consideration has been given to avoidances external to the plant. We develop a conceptual framework of external plant avoidances of herbivory based on foraging selection impedances (associational avoidances), behavioral impedances (indirect avoidances), and physical impedances (refuges) organized along axes of efficiency, degree of protection, and necessity of tolerance characteristics. Associational avoidances are uncommon for terrestrial mammalian herbivores compared to plant-insect or marine situations. Indirect avoidances mediated through herbivore territoriality, predator avoidance, and other behaviors independent of foraging decisions are probably common in nature, but few have been formally documented. Biotic and geologic refuges providing a physical impedance are the only avoidances shown to have implications for plant biodiversity. This is particularly true for geologic refuges, where there is not a tradeoff between competition and the refuge effect. Small geologic refuges (rock outcrops, cliffs, etc.) are more likely to also positively or negatively alter associated plant microenvironments than large geologic refuges (mesas, islands, etc.). In a survey, 86% of small refuge studies reported positive effects on plant diversity compared to 50% for large refuges. Geologic refuges in more productive environments were more important in protecting diversity than refuges in less productive, semiarid environments, and the effects of protection were greater in communities with short compared to long evolutionary histories of grazing. Other characteristics of refuges such as extent across the landscape and the manner they alter or ameliorate the environment, as well as characteristics of the herbivore such as small or large, generalist or specialist may also determine the effectiveness of refuges, but there are too few studies to assess these factors.},

Above- and below-ground woody biomass were estimated from vegetation measurement surveys, and litter and soil (0-50 cm depth) C from samplings. At the year of abandonment, total C content of both PL and NS sites averaged 100 ± 13 Mg C ha-1. Over 50 years, total C content doubled on NS sites and tripled on PL sites (217.9 ± 28.7 vs. 285.7 ± 31.0 Mg ha-1) with respect to fallow land. On NS sites, the new C stocks accumulated entirely in the vegetation. On PL sites, C accumulated mostly in the vegetation and to a lesser extent in the litter, whereas it decreased by a third in the soil. As a result, the net C accumulation rate was 1.7 ± 0.7 Mg ha-1 yr-1 greater on PL sites than on NS sites over 50 years.

   abstract = {Facilitation by a neighboring woody understory has been suggested as a cost-effective and sustainable way to regenerate oaks. However, concerns about reduced plant growth and quality due to competing neighboring vegetation have hindered implementation. Here we studied competitive effects from herbaceous and woody vegetation on survival, growth, canopy development and stem quality in pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) in an open-field experiment in southern Sweden. Oaks were grown for eight years in four different competition treatments: no competing vegetation, with herbaceous vegetation (mainly grasses), with woody vegetation, and with both herbaceous and woody vegetation. During the first four years, competition had little effect on oak survival. However, after eight growing seasons, survival rates decreased to about 20% for oaks surrounded by woody vegetation, in contrast to oaks grown with only herbaceous vegetation that had a survival rate of near 100%. Competition from herbaceous and woody vegetation both reduced oak stem diameter and height growth, but they affected height growth differently. During the first growing seasons, oaks in the treatment with woody vegetation were able to keep up with the height growth of the surrounding vegetation. Thereafter, height growth stagnated, and after eight growing seasons heights of oaks in the treatment with woody competitors were only 30–39% that of oaks in the treatment without competing vegetation. In contrast, competition from herbaceous vegetation only restricted oak height development marginally. Interspecific competition not only restricted growth and survival but also shifted shoot architecture, resulting in a greater frequency of oaks with straight monopodial stems. Although competition from both herbaceous- and woody vegetation positively affected stem straightness, plots with woody vegetation had a greater proportion (0.42) of oaks with a single straight monopodial stem. Our results demonstrate that the facilitative competitive effects from herbaceous and woody vegetation could be used to control allocation patterns in young oaks, promoting development of tall straight monopodial stems. Considering the observed trade-off between high stem quality and survival, we recommend long-term assessment of this trade-off prior to application in practical forestry.},

This study took place in a beech woodland over the 5-year period immediately after a heavy thinning to leave a basal area of 6.5 m2 ha-1. Development of the ground flora and the growth and browsing of birch and willow seedlings were observed annually at the end of the summer. The ground flora became dominated by a dense thicket of bramble c. 60 cm tall. The tree species differed in their susceptibility to browsing with a greater percentage of willow being browsed than birch. Similarly, willow seedling mortality was greater. Over the 5-year period, the average height of birch reached c. 2 m compared with c. 0.6 m for willow. For both species, there were significant positive relationships between seedling height and diameter and bramble cover and heights indicating that bramble facilitates the establishment of both willow and birch. Bramble reduced the incidence of browsing, an effect which appeared to be due to its relationship with seedling size. The potential role of bramble in the facilitation of naturally regenerating tree seedlings within woodlands is discussed. © 2009 Institute of Chartered Foresters. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Ungulate browsing is one of the many factors that affect structure and species composition of forests. Silver fir (Abies alba) is a highly desirable tree species in many European mountain regions, but at the same time one of the most preferred tree species by ungulates. Failure of natural fir regeneration is thus often attributed to browsing.We employ natural light gradients with planted fir saplings but natural browsing to analyze: (i) under which light conditions fir saplings grow and survive best; (ii) where and which ungulate species browse saplings; and (iii) which saplings react and survive best after browsing. The experiment was carried out in a Swiss forest in two fenced plots where parts extended from closed stands into gaps and an unfenced plot under closed canopy. On the three plots 803 fir saplings had been planted in 2008. On half of the total area, browsing had been allowed in at least the winter of 2009/2010.The more light available, the better was the growth of the saplings before and after browsing. For canopy openness. ≥11%, some fir saplings had large height increments irrespective of the exact light level. Video surveillance demonstrated that chamois was the only browsing ungulate species. Mortality was positively correlated with light availability, probably due to site preparation, i.e. mainly where ground vegetation was abundant, and with mouse browsing in one plot. Mortality due to chamois or mice was 2.8-16.4% in plots unfenced for one winter and 52% in the plot unfenced for three winters. A small fraction (10%) of browsed saplings that survived used flagging of a twig to form a new leader, and fully compensated for browsing-related height loss. The other saplings showed a partial compensation in the 2nd year after browsing with equally long shoots, but they still remained shorter than unbrowsed saplings. Saplings under a very dense canopy often did not react (7%).The strong impacts of ungulates on fir recruitment are thus more due to the strong preference of the ungulates for this tree species rather than to a low tolerance of fir to browsing. We do not recommend planting firs in forest gaps due to higher mortality rates, since: (1) competition with ground vegetation is higher in gaps, (2) they risk becoming desiccated and (3) mouse browsing is more likely. Thus we provide evidence that A. alba regeneration benefits from moderately shaded conditions. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Roads can affect animals in several ways, by affecting movement, space use, foraging behavior and mortality. As roads often have a negative effect on populations of birds and mammals, their effects are important for wildlife management. However, the effect of roads differ between different types of roads, and most studies of road ecology have focused on major roads with high traffic intensity, whilst effects of smaller unpaved forest roads in northern ecosystems are less known. We investigated the effects of forest roads in a mixed conifer forest in central Europe on cervid habitat use and browsing impact on forest regeneration during the winter season. We found that hunted cervid species avoided forest roads, and that browsing pressure was higher within the core of forest areas rather than close to roads. This led to an increased density of undamaged trees (by browsing) close to forest roads, whilst browsing damages were relatively high in the interior. Hunters often use these forest roads in the hunting season. We suggest that human disturbance creates corridors of fear along forest roads, and that cervids alter their habitat and browse use to avoid humans. This in turn has implications for forest and cervid management. This is the first study to document that gravel roads can affect oak trees through modifying cervid behavior. Future studies should use experiments to explore this question further and separate different effects of forest roads to understand the mechanisms; edge effects on vegetation, traffic, effects on natural predators and human disturbance.},

   abstract = {Over recent decades, deer populations have reached densities exceeding their natural range of variability in several regions worldwide. Abundant deer populations can change the composition and structure of understory plant communities in forests and trigger trophic cascades affecting animal communities. To investigate such indirect effects on boreal forest songbirds we compared the understory vegetation and songbird communities of balsam fir stands on Anticosti Island (Quebec, Canada), where white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) were introduced, to those of the neighbouring Mingan Archipelago, where deer are absent. Mean cover of trees at 02 m height was on average sevenfold higher on Mingan than on Anticosti, and songbirds dependent on the understory were more common on Mingan than on Anticosti. Songbird community composition was more variable on Mingan, suggesting that the opening of the forest understory on Anticosti through intensive browsing homogenized the songbird community by reducing the occurrence of understory-dependent species. These indirect effects on songbirds were similar, although less dramatic, than those described in temperate forests. We interpret this as a consequence of lower productivity and complexity in understory vegetation of boreal forests. Our results emphasize the negative effects of abundant deer populations on animal diversity and underline the role played in the dynamics of communities by top down factors that regulate herbivore populations.},

   abstract = {Debate on the relative importance of competition for resources and trophic interactions in shaping the biological diversity of living communities remains unsettled after almost a century. Recently, dramatic increases in ungulate populations have provided a useful quasi-experiment on the effects of unrestrained ungulates on forest ecology. The islands of Haida Gwaii (Canada) offer a unique situation to investigate the potential of large herbivores to control temperate forest community structure and diversity. Black-tailed deer Odocoileus hemionus Merriam, native to adjacent mainland areas of British Columbia, were introduced in 1878 and spread to all but a few islands. Because deer were not native to the archipelago, islands that still lack deer provide a rare instance of temperate forest vegetation and fauna that developed in the absence of large herbivores. The colonisation of different islands at different times, and the absence of significant predation allow us to assess whether and how a large herbivore can exert "top-down" control on vegetation and its associated fauna. We studied plant communities in forest interior and shoreline, on seven small islands of varying browse history. Three islands were untouched by deer, deer had been resident for about 15 years on two, and on another two deer had been present for more than 50 years. Without deer, vegetation in the understorey and/or shrub layer was dense or very dense. Structure and composition varied markedly within and between shoreline and interior communities. Without deer, shoreline communities were dominated by species absent from islands with deer. Where deer had been present for less than 20 years most plant species characteristic of shorelines on islands without deer were already absent or scarce, but in the forest interior species richness was less affected and extensive shrub thickets remained. On islands where deer had been present for >50 years vegetation below the browse line was extremely simplified, converging in both forest interior and shoreline towards an open assemblage of a few deer-tolerant species, basically two coniferous trees. This top down effect on the plant community reflected up the food chain so that understorey invertebrate and shrub-dependent songbird communities became simplified. In contrast, species densities of litter arthropods (especially weevils and millipedes) were highest where deer were present for >50 years. Canopy birds were unaffected by deer presence. In the absence of predators, major climatic stress or other means to control the herbivore, deer browsing created greatly simplified plant and animal communities. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

   abstract = {White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) were introduced 100 y ago on Anticosti, a 7,943-km2 island located in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Québec. The forest of the island is typically boreal and, at the time of the introduction, was dominated by balsam fir (Abies balsamea), white spruce (Picea glauca), and black spruce (P. mariana). Since then, the vegetation has been modified as a result of high deer density (16 deer·km-2) and heavy browsing. The most important change is the progressive decline of balsam fir stands, formerly the prevalent forest type. We describe that process at three spatial and time scales. On the largest scale (whole island, 100 y , we examined the age and species composition of stands on recent forest maps as well as the age structure of 2,555 individual balsam fir and white spruce trees. Balsam fir was largely dominant before 1930, but was replaced by white spruce afterwards. We also estimated that fir stands, which now cover 20% of the island, occupied about 40% of the total area initially. On an intermediate scale (1,200 km2, 30 y), we examined the natural regeneration established after an insect outbreak that took place in 1971-1972 and massively killed predominantly balsam fir forests. In that area, white spruce regeneration now largely replaces that of balsam fir. On a finer scale (< 1 km2, 3 y), we monitored 1,800 balsam fir seedlings (2-5 cm high) individually tagged. Seedlings were browsed throughout the snow-free season, and the annual browsing incidence in forest was estimated at 26%. Considering the present age of remnant fir stands, we estimate that most of these will have been eradicated in 40-50 y.},

We used patch-use theory (marginal-value theorem) to predict under which circumstances we should expect plants to gain protection from herbivory due to association with other plants. The predictions were tested in two field experiments, in which voles and mountain hares utilized stands consisting of a moderately preferred species (birch) mixed with a plant species of higher palatability (rowan in the vole experiment and aspen in the hare experiment) or lower palatability (alder). In both the vole- and hare-experiment, birch was least utilized when associated with plants of lower palatability, consistent with predictions from patch-use theory. However, food utilization by hares and voles differed from that predicted by patch-use theory in one respect: food selection occurred both at the stand and the plant level and not at the stand level only, indicating simultaneous optimization at stand and plant level.},

Deer distribution and resulting herbivory patterns are variable across a landscape due to habitat patchiness and topography. It is poorly understood how features associated with topography control deer herbivory. We examined the heterogeneity of deer herbivory as it affects sapling densities across a single forest-type landscape on the Cumberland Plateau. The 1242 hectare site represented a peninsula of tableland that transitioned from developed land to forest and was surrounded on three sides by a bluff, irregularly punctuated by drainages. We examined the spatial variability of deer impacts on sapling density and modeled the relative importance of plateau accessibility features related to topography, proximity to edge, and deer culling as predictors of sapling variation. We used a stratified random design to sample sapling density across the landscape in 2012 and 2015. The intensity of deer herbivory on saplings varied, with the fewest saplings in forests surrounded by residential development. Our model predicted that plateau accessibility measures best determined sapling densities, followed by distance from edge and deer culling measures. Our results suggest that herbivory impacts may not be homogeneous in a contiguous uniform landscape if there are topographic barriers.},

   abstract = {1. The density of large herbivores is a major driver of forest ecosystem structure and function in conjunction with episodic disturbances, especially in forests with a regeneration strategy based on shade-tolerant seedlings capable of re-establishing canopy dominance (advance regeneration). Yet, uncertainty about the relationships between forest regeneration, herbivore density and other disturbances makes it difficult to set population goals. Using an innovative controlled browsing experiment, we investigated the relationships between the regeneration dynamics of balsam fir Abies balsamea, the density of white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus and timber harvesting. 2. We hypothesize that advance tree regeneration either: (i) recovers approximately linearly as deer density is reduced; (ii) recovers exponentially; or (iii) does not recover because factors other than browsing control advance regeneration. We tested these alternatives through manipulation of deer densities (0, 7.5, 15 deer km-2 and in situ local densities) and forest cover (clearcut and uncut forest). 3. Balsam fir seedling mortality decreased exponentially with decreasing deer density in clearcut and approximately linearly in uncut forest. Independently of deer density, the recruitment of seedlings in clearcut dropped from 56 ± 5% to 7 ± 1% within 3 years. 4. Seedling growth increased exponentially with decreasing deer density in clearcut whereas no height growth was observed in uncut forest. 5. Overall, the abundance of fir saplings recovered exponentially in clearcut but remained low and independent of deer density in uncut forest. The abundance of spruce Picea spp. saplings was unrelated to deer density and increased with time. 6. Synthesis and applications. Forest disturbance from selective browsing at high deer densities over an extended period of time leads to recruitment failure following a canopy disturbance such as a clearcut. Indirect competitive advantage given to species resistant to browsing can shift forest composition. Nonlinear relationships between fir regeneration and deer densities imply that the level of culling required to reach herbivore densities compatible with natural regeneration of native forest is larger than expected if tree regeneration was proportional to deer density. In the boreal forest of Anticosti Island, local densities < 15 deer km-2 achieved within 3 years following clearcut are compatible with the maintenance of native forest. © 2007 The Authors.},

For example, many northern European populations of free-ranging ungulates have reached unprecedented levels, which can influence plant species turnover, long-term maintenance of biodiversity and the subsequent stability of boreal ecosystems. However, the mechanisms by which large herbivores affect spatial and temporal vegetation heterogeneity remain poorly understood. Here, we combined a 10-year exclusion experiment with a herbivore intensity gradient to investigate how red deer (Cervus elaphus) acts as a driver of temporal and spatial heterogeneity in the understory of a boreal forest. We measured the two dimensions of heterogeneity as temporal and spatial species turnover. We found that temporal heterogeneity was positively related to herbivory intensity, and we found a similar trend for spatial heterogeneity. Removing red deer (exclosure) from our study system caused a distinct shift in species composition, both spatially (slow response) and temporally (quick response). Vegetation from which red deer had been excluded for 10 years showed the highest spatial heterogeneity, suggesting that the most stable forest understory will occur where there are no large herbivores. However, excluding red deer resulted in lower species diversity and greater dominance by a low number of plant species. If both stable but species rich ecosystems are the management goal, these findings suggest that naturally fluctuating, but moderate red deer densities should be sustained.},

We tested the validity of pellet group distribution as a tool for habitat selection studies by comparing the distribution of moose pellet groups in four different forest age categories (forest age <30, 31-60, 61-90, >90 years) and mire with GPS positions from collared moose (Alces alces). Sample plots (n = 531) were cleaned from pellet during the fall 2007 and the number of new pellet groups were counted in spring 2008, thus resulting in a defined period of accumulation. In addition, pellet groups were counted in paired, uncleaned, control plots. GPS data from 15 collared moose monitored during the same period were used for comparison with habitat composition and distribution of pellet groups. Both the distribution of pellet groups and GPS positions differed significantly from the habitat composition within the study area. Young forest stands (<30 years) were significantly more used than both forests >30 years and mire. The selection by moose, as calculated by Manly's alpha, showed identical ranking among habitat classes for cleaned sample plots and GPS data whereas uncleaned plots showed a shifted rank order for two of the habitat classes.

   abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

   abstract = {Despite decades of intense research, it remains largely unsolved which nutritional factors underpin food selection by large herbivores in the wild. We measured nutritional composition of birch foliage (Betula pubescens) available to, and used by, moose (Alces alces) in natural settings in two neighboring regions with contrasting animal body mass. This readily available food source is a staple food item in the diet of moose in the high-fitness region, but apparently underutilized by moose in the low-fitness region. Available birch foliage in the two regions had similar concentrations of macronutrients (crude protein [CP], fiber fractions, and water-soluble carbohydrates [WSC]), although a notably lower variation of WSC in the low-fitness region. For minerals, there were several area differences: available birch foliage in the low-fitness region had less Mg (depending on year) and P, but more Ca, Zn, Cu, and Mn. It also had higher concentrations of some plant secondary metabolites: chlorogenic acids, quercetins, and especially MeOH-soluble condensed tannins. Despite the area differences in available foliage, we found the same nutritional composition of birch foliage used in the two regions. Compared to available birch foliage, moose consistently used birch foliage with more CP, more structural fiber (mainly hemicellulose), less WSC, higher concentrations of several minerals (Ca, Zn, K, Mn, Cu), and lower concentrations of some secondary metabolites (most importantly, MeOH-soluble condensed tannins). Our study conceptually supports the nutrient-balancing hypothesis for a large herbivore: within a given temporal frame, moose select for plant material that matches a specific nutritional composition. As our data illustrate, different moose populations may select for the same composition even when the nutritional composition available in a given food source varies between their living areas. Such fastidiousness limits the proportion of available food that is acceptable to the animal and has bearings on our understanding and application of the concept of carrying capacity.},

We then show how the Geometric Framework has been used to understand the links between nutrition and relevant aspects of the biology of individual animals. These aspects include the physiological mechanisms that direct the nutritional interactions of the animal with its environment, and the fitness consequences of these interactions.

   abstract = {The nutrient balancing hypothesis proposes that, when sufficient food is available, the primary goal of animal diet selection is to obtain a nutritionally balanced diet. This hypothesis can be tested using the Geometric Framework for nutrition (GF). The GF enables researchers to study patterns of nutrient intake (e.g. macronutrients; protein, carbohydrates, fat), interactions between the different nutrients, and how an animal resolves the potential conflict between over-eating one or more nutrients and under-eating others during periods of dietary imbalance. Using the moose (Alces alces L.), a model species in the development of herbivore foraging theory, we conducted a feeding experiment guided by the GF, combining continuous observations of six captive moose with analysis of the macronutritional composition of foods. We identified the moose's self-selected macronutrient target by allowing them to compose a diet by mixing two nutritionally complementary pellet types plus limited access to Salix browse. Such periods of free choice were intermixed with periods when they were restricted to one of the two pellet types plus Salix browse. Our observations of food intake by moose given free choice lend support to the nutrient balancing hypothesis, as the moose combined the foods in specific proportions that provided a particular ratio and amount of macronutrients. When restricted to either of two diets comprising a single pellet type, the moose i) maintained a relatively stable intake of non-protein energy while allowing protein intakes to vary with food composition, and ii) increased their intake of the food item that most closely resembled the self-selected macronutrient intake from the free choice periods, namely Salix browse. We place our results in the context of the nutritional strategy of the moose, ruminant physiology and the categorization of food quality.},

   abstract = {People provide wild ungulates with large quantities of supplementary feed to improve their health and survival and reduce forest damage. Whereas supplementary feeding can positively affect the winter survival of ungulates and short-term hunting success, some of the feeds provided may actually reduce ungulate health and increase forest damage. Here, we highlight how recent advances in ungulate nutritional ecology can help explain why supplementary feeding can lead to undesirable outcomes. Using Europe’s largest cervid, the moose (Alces alces), as a model species, and Sweden, as the socio-ecological context, we explain the concept of nutritional balancing and its relevance to supplementary feeding. Nutritional balancing refers to how animals alter their food intake to achieve a specific nutritional target balance in their diet, by selecting balanced food items or by combining items with nutritional compositions that are complimentary. As the most common supplementary feeds used contain higher concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates than the ungulates’ normal winter diet, the consumption of such feeds may cause animals to increase their intake of woody browse, and thereby exacerbate forest damage. We also explain how animal health may be negatively affected by large intakes of such feed if complementary browse items are not available. We therefore suggest that the use of inappropriate feed is an additional means by which supplementary feeding may result in negative outcomes for hunters, forest owners, and wild animals.},

   abstract = {The research literature on food selection by large herbivores is extensive. Still, we are generally lacking in our knowledge of the influence of potentially interacting chemical contents of the food. We made a qualitative review of a systematic literature search of studies that empirically link chemical contents of food to the food selection by northern cervids (genera Alces, Capreolus, Cervus, Dama, Odocoileus, Rangifer). We found that although the majority of the 98 relevant studies measuring any given food constituent (energy, protein, fiber, minerals, plant secondary metabolites) provided support for it acting as a driver of food selection (in either a negative or positive way), there was little support for the traditional hypotheses of maximization or limitation of any single constituent. Rather, because of the animals’ need to acquire an appropriate intake of several constituents at the same time, our review highlights how new empirical studies need to focus on several food constituents in synchrony: (1) Study designs should capture sufficient variation in the content of food constituents in order to tease apart their many co-variations; and (2) insights about nutritional drivers may be lost if one uses only composite currencies such as crude energy, crude fiber, ash, or tannins, which may mask contrasting selection patterns of the lumped constituents. Season had an apparent influence on the selection of some food constituents, particularly various fiber fractions. In contrast, our review revealed a lack of evidence that cervids more strongly select for protein in summer than they do in winter. Our overall conclusion of the review is that interacting chemical contents of food make the nutritional value of a given food type into a varying entity. To better elucidate this variation, we need new technologies that non-invasively capture nutrient intake of free-ranging animals, across seasons.},

   abstract = {We review the evidence for behavioral avoidance of plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) and identify how, and the circumstances under which it occurs. Behavioral strategies of avoidance of PSM can only be fully understood in relation to the underlying physiological processes or constraints. There is considerable evidence that animals learn to avoid PSMs on the basis of negative postingestive effects. The extent to which this process determines foraging choices is limited by the ability of animals to experience the consequences of their behaviors and associate particular cues in foods with their specific effects in the body. The proposed learning mechanisms require that animals must at least "sample" plants that contain PSMs. They do not completely avoid PSMs, but there is evidence that they restrict their ingestion to within limits that they are physiologically able to tolerate, and that the amounts of PSM ingested result from a balance between toxicological considerations and the nutrient content of the plant material. These limits are influenced by the kinetics of PSM elimination, which underlies patterns of bite and patch selection from plant parts to landscapes. We suggest that altering spatial location of feeding (to alternative food patches or alternative foods within patches, including plant parts), and temporal distribution of feeding activity, by either cessation of feeding or by continuing to feed, but on alternative foods, can both lead to reduction of the intake and toxic effects of PSMs. We propose that the strategy of avoidance or reduction of intake of PSMs coevolved with the animal's ability to physiologically tolerate their ingestion, and that avoidance and tolerance are inversely related (the avoidance-tolerance continuum). The animals' propensity and ability to seek alternatives also vary with the dispersion of their food resources. Further work is required to test these proposals and integrate temporal and spatial aspects of foraging behavior and its nutritional consequences in relation to PSMs. © Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2006.},

   abstract = {(Table presented.). Summary: Mast seeding is a widespread and widely studied phenomenon. However, the physiological mechanisms that mediate masting events and link them to weather and plant resources are still debated. Here, we explore how masting is affected by plant resource budgets, fruit maturation success, and hormonal coordination of cues including weather and resources. There is little empirical support for the commonly stated hypothesis that plants store carbohydrates over several years to expend in a high-seed year. Plants can switch carbohydrates away from growth in high-seed years, and seed crops are more probably limited by nitrogen or phosphorus. Resources are clearly involved in the proximate mechanisms driving masting, but resource budget (RB) models cannot create masting in the absence of selection because some underlying selective benefit is required to set the level of a ‘full’ seed crop at greater than the annual resource increment. Economies of scale (EOSs) provide the ultimate factor selecting for masting, but EOSs probably always interact with resources, which modify the relationship between weather cues and reproduction. Thus, RB and EOS models are not alternative explanations for masting – both are required. Experiments manipulating processes that affect mast seeding will help clarify the physiological mechanisms that underlie mast seeding.},

Next to calculating species-specific biomass equations for the species available in the dataset, we also calculated generic biomass equations for all broadleaved species and all conifer species.

However the recovery of deer and wolf populations in many parts of the northern hemisphere has resulted in conflicts and controversies rather than in relief. Both species interact in complex ways with their environment, each other, and humans. We review these interactions in the context of the ecological and human costs and benefits associated with these species. We integrate scattered information to widen our perspective on the nature and perception of these costs and benefits and how they link to each other and ongoing controversies regarding how we manage deer and wolf populations. After revisiting the ecological roles deer and wolves play in contemporary ecosystems, we explore how they interact, directly and indirectly, with human groups including farmers, foresters, shepherds, and hunters. Interactions with deer and wolves generate various axes of tension, posing both ecological and sociological challenges. Resolving these tensions and conflicts requires that we address key questions using integrative approaches: what are the ecological consequences of deer and wolf recovery? How do they influence each other? What are the social and socio-ecological consequences of large deer populations and wolf presence? Finally, what key obstacles must be overcome to allow deer, wolves and people to coexist? Reviewing contemporary ecological and sociological results suggests insights and ways to improve our understanding and resolve long-standing challenges to coexistence. We should begin by agreeing to enhance aggregate benefits while minimizing the collective costs we incur by interacting with deer and wolves. We should also view these species, and ourselves, as parts of integrated ecosystems subject to long-term dynamics. If co-existence is our goal, we need deer and wolves to persevere in ways that are compatible with human interests. Our human interests, however, should be inclusive and fairly value all the costs and benefits deer and wolves entail including their intrinsic value. Shifts in human attitudes and cultural learning that are already occurring will reshape our ecological interactions with deer and wolves.},

   abstract = {The two most pressing challenges to agriculture worldwide are feeding a rapidly growing human population and developing more sustainable agricultural practices that do not threaten human and ecosystem health. We address these challenges through research in plant-herbivore interactions, specifically overcompensatory responses in potato to herbivore damage. While herbivory is usually detrimental to most crops, some potato cultivars can overcompensate and increase crop productivity up to two-fold in response to herbivore damage. However, biotic and abiotic factors are known to influence compensatory responses. Here we tested if compensatory plant responses to herbivory increase productivity of potatoes under field conditions along gradients of altitude and landscape simplification in 15 different farms. Our results suggest that compensatory plant responses could double the mean productivity of a potato farm in relation to the productivity of undamaged plants. The compensatory response is best predicted by pest pressure on a farm with potato plants having the maximum productivity when 10% of the tubers are damaged and decreasing in productivity as pest pressure increases. To a lesser extent an interaction between altitude and landscape simplification did affect the compensatory response, suggesting that abiotic factors play an important role in compensation. Our results suggest that overcompensation-based management practices could be used to maximize yields on working potato farms. Further research is required to determine action thresholds (i.e. the damage levels at which pest control needs to be enacted to maximize yields and minimize insecticide use) to develop more sustainable ways of increasing yields in the future.},

Although the unfenced plots had no seedlings higher than 20 cm, there were seedlings up to 120 cm in the fenced plot. These results suggest that 13-year fencing promoted regeneration of seedlings in this area. © 2006 The Japanese Forest Society and Springer-Verlag.},

   abstract = {Livestock grazing is the principal land use in arid central Asia, and range degradation is considered a serious problem within much of the high-elevation region of western China termed the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Rangeland degradation on the QTP is variously attributed to poor livestock management, historical-cultural factors, changing land tenure arrangements or socioeconomic systems, climate change, and damage from small mammals. Few studies have examined currently managed pastures using detailed data capable of isolating fine-scale livestock-vegetation interactions. The aim of the study was to understand how differences among livestock (primarily sheep) management strategies of pastoralists during winter affected subsequent rangeland condition and productivity. Plant species composition, annual herbage mass, and indicators of erosion were quantified during four summers (2009-2012) on winter pastures managed by 11 different pastoralists on QTP steppe rangeland in Qinghai Province, China. Data came from repeated-measurements on 317 systematically located permanent plots, as well as pastoralist interviews and the use of GPS-equipped livestock. Relationships between annual weather variation and herbage mass were modelled using an independent set of vegetation measurements obtained from livestock exclosures. Account was taken of inherent site differences among pastures. Annual variation in herbage mass was found to be best fitted by a model containing a negative function of winter-season temperature and a positive function of spring-season temperature. Accounting for annual and site effects, significant differences among pastoralists were found for most response variables, suggesting that individual heterogeneity among management approaches had consequences, even among neighbouring pastoralists. Annual herbage mass of preferred plant species was positively associated, whereas that of unpreferred species was negatively associated, with mean sheep density and intensity of use. However, the proportion of bare soil, an index of erosion, and annual herbage mass of unpreferred forbs were found to have positive relationships with sheep grazing pressure during the preceding winter, whereas live vegetation cover and annual herbage mass of preferred grasses were negatively related. Thus, on a spatial scale, pastoralists responded adaptively to the cover of preferred plant species while not responding to total annual herbage mass. Pastoralists stocked pastures more heavily, and livestock used regions within pastures more intensively, where preferred species had a higher cover. However, where sheep grazing pressure was high, downward temporal trends in the herbage mass of preferred species were exacerbated. Pastures that were stocked at a lower density did not experience the negative trends seen in those with a higher density.},

   abstract = {Natural regeneration in canopy gaps is a key process affecting long-term dynamics of many forests, including northern hardwood forests. The density and composition of regenerating trees are often highly variable, reflecting sensitivity to a suite of driving factors operating at different scales (e.g., harvest gap to regional landscape), including production of seeds, physical characteristics of gaps and stands, competition with non-tree vegetation, and browsing by animals. Multivariate analyses over broad geographic areas provide insights into the relative effects of these factors and permit exploration of spatial patterns in regeneration. We examined the effects of gap-, stand-, and landscape-scale factors on densities of tree seedlings (<1m tall) and saplings (1-2m tall) in 59 selection-harvested northern hardwood stands located across a 4500km2 region of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. We used Bayesian multilevel modeling to account for the hierarchical structure of the data and assess uncertainty in parameter estimates. Sugar maple (Acer saccharum) saplings were absent from 61% of 154m2 plots centered in harvest gaps (n=347) despite its high shade tolerance and overstory dominance, but densities were high in other gaps. Densities of sugar maple seedlings and/or saplings were negatively associated with a combination of greater stand-scale densities of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), greater gap-scale cover of non-tree vegetation, and lower gap-scale light availability, with deer density having the greatest effect. Densities of unpalatable and commercially less valuable ironwood (Ostrya virginiana), the second most common regeneration species, were positively related to gap-scale seed-production potential but were unrelated to factors affecting sugar maple. Ironwood tended to replace sugar maple saplings in areas with high deer density. At the landscape scale, densities of sugar maple seedlings and saplings decreased with decreasing latitude and snow depth and increasing winter deer densities. These inverse spatial patterns suggest that deer herbivory can lead to landscape-scale variation in regeneration success. However, the spatial distribution of habitat types (a proxy for soil moisture and nutrient conditions) confound this observation, with higher densities of sugar maple generally located on stands with less nutrient-rich habitat types. Results demonstrate that combinations of factors operating at different scales, and with different relative magnitudes of impact, contribute to high variation in regeneration composition and density following timber harvest. Selection silvicultural practices, as currently applied, do not ensure regeneration of desirable species; practices might require modifications in general (e.g., increasing gap size) and to match them to regionally varying factors like deer density. © 2011.},

   abstract = {One of the most important ecosystem processes, especially in temperate and boreal forests, is herbivore browsing. In this study, we tested five hypotheses: (H1) oak tree density would positively affect their height; (H2) despite severe browsing pressure, the height of oaks would increase with the age after planting; (H3) oaks growing among the planted pines would be taller than those among the sown ones; (H4) the growth of single oak saplings or of oak nests would be positively affected by the height of the pines growing in the immediate neighbourhood of the oaks; and (H5) the oak height would be affected by the location within a nest and oaks growing in the central zone would be taller than the others. The study was conducted in the Piska Forest in the north-eastern part of Poland. We established three variants of experiment. In the first variant, oaks were planted individually. In the second and third variants, oaks were planted in small nests. The second and third variants differed in the spacing of the nests: 8 × 8 m and 6 × 6 m, respectively. The division into the sub-variants referred to type of pine regeneration. In the first sub-variant, Scots pine was planted. In the second, pine was sown. In general, oaks growing within nests were significantly taller than those planted individually in the Scots pine rows. Despite heavy browsing, oak height consistently increased during the course of the study. Oak height also depended on the type of pine regeneration, and the mean height of oaks surrounded by planted pines was significantly higher than that of oaks surrounded by sown pines (which, in average, was shorter). That was because the planted pines were taller than the sown ones. We found that Spearman’s correlation coefficients were positive and significant between pine and oak heights in variants 2 and 3. Growth of oaks did not depend on their location within a nest. The results of the regeneration method of oak (single vs nest and few vs many nests) are modified by browsing. The best method found in the heavy browsing circumstances was planting oaks in many nests within successful pine regeneration (providing the oaks with protection against the browsing). The pine will provide the most efficient protection if regenerated a few years before the oaks.},

   abstract = {Failed oak regeneration is widely reported in temperate forests and has been linked in part to changed disturbance regimes and land-use. We investigated if the North American fire–oak hypothesis could be applicable to temperate European oaks (Quercus robur, Quercus petraea) using a replicated field experiment with contrasting canopy openness, protection against ungulate browsing (fencing/no fencing), and low-intensity surface fire (burn/no burn). Survival, relative height growth (RGRH), browsing damage on naturally regenerated oaks (≤300 cm tall), and changes in competing woody vegetation were monitored over three years. Greater light availability in canopy gaps increased oak RGRH (p =.034) and tended to increase survival (p =.092). There was also a trend that protection from browsing positively affected RGRH (p =.058) and survival (p =.059). Burning reduced survival (p <.001), nonetheless, survival rates were relatively high across treatment combinations at the end of the experiment (54%–92%). Most oaks receiving fire were top-killed and survived by producing new sprouts; therefore, RGRH in burned plots became strongly negative the first year. Thereafter, RGRH was greater in burned plots (p =.002). Burning altered the patterns of ungulate browsing frequency on oaks. Overall, browsing frequency was greater during winter; however, in recently burned plots summer browsing was prominent. Burning did not change relative density of oaks, but it had a clear effect on competing woody vegetation as it reduced the number of individuals (p <.001) and their heights (p <.001). Our results suggest that young, temperate European oaks may respond similarly to fire as their North American congeners. However, disturbance from a single low-intensity fire may not be sufficient to ensure a persistent competitive advantage—multiple fires and canopy thinning to increase light availability may be needed. Further research investigating long-term fire effects on oaks of various ages, species-specific response of competitors and implications for biodiversity conservation is needed.},

   abstract = {In most mixed-species forestry systems, regeneration is a critical step for individual tree survival and species coexistence. Species coexistence is driven by the fine-scale spatial patterns and competitive abilities of species. In naturally regenerated mixed oak (Quercus petraea and Quercus robur: QP and QR, respectively) stands, species coexistence was assessed by analysing the spatial distribution of both species and their growth responses to intra- and interspecific competition. Four sites located in North Eastern France with an established (1.4–2.8-m-high) mixed QP and QR regeneration were selected for the study. In a first step, individual seedling location was recorded along line transects to analyse the spatial distribution of the two species. Univariate pair correlation functions were used to test for spatial aggregation for each species and bivariate pair correlation functions were used to test for spatial associations between the two species. In a second step, seedlings were measured in small plots to analyse their response to local competition. Mixed linear models were used to estimate the combined effects of density, mixture, seedling size and seedling status on seedling growth. QP and QR were both highly aggregated in monospecific patches, and the two species were strongly segregated at a decametric scale. Transition zones between monospecific patches were reduced to a few meters. For both species, mixture had no effect on seedling growth. In all sites, the two species showed very similar diameter and height growth rates in response to density, mixture, seedling size and seedling status, and similar intra- and interspecific competitive abilities. Highly patchy patterns of QP and QR regeneration strongly reduce interactions between the two species and, in transition zones between monospecific patches where the two species are mixed, no species is expected to outcompete its companion species. For each species, long-term persistence at the stand scale is determined by intraspecific competition rather than by interspecific competition. At this developmental stage, the QP-QR mixture appears to be very stable and no specific silvicultural treatment is required to maintain the mixture.},

   abstract = {The estimates of contemporary gene flow assessed based on naturally established seedlings provide information much needed for understanding the abilities of forest tree populations to persist under global changes through migration and/or adaptation facilitated by gene exchange among populations. Here, we investigated pollen- and seed-mediated gene flow in two mixed-oak forest stands (consisting of Quercus robur L. and Q. petraea [Matt.] Liebl.). The gene flow parameters were estimated based on microsatellite multilocus genotypes of seedlings and adults and their spatial locations within the sample plots using models that attempt to reconstruct the genealogy of the seedling cohorts. Pollen and seed dispersal were modelled using the standard seedling neighbourhood model and a modification - the 2-component seedling neighbourhood model, with the later allowing separation of the dispersal process into local and long-distance components. The 2-component model fitted the data substantially better than the standard model and provided estimates of mean seed and pollen dispersal distances accounting for long-distance propagule dispersal. The mean distance of effective pollen dispersal was found to be 298 and 463 m, depending on the stand, while the mean distance of effective seed dispersal was only 8.8 and 15.6 m, which is consistent with wind pollination and primarily seed dispersal by gravity in Quercus. Some differences observed between the two stands could be attributed to the differences in the stand structure of the adult populations and the existing understory vegetation. Such a mixture of relatively limited seed dispersal with occasional long distance gene flow seems to be an efficient strategy for colonizing new habitats with subsequent local adaptation, while maintaining genetic diversity within populations. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {The number, size, and location of gaps in a forest canopy have a direct influence on the availability and distribution of understory light. The quantity and spectral quality of this incident solar energy, in turn, plays a significant role in determining the abundance and diversity of understory plants, the growth and mortality of seedlings, and the development, structure, and species composition of the canopy trees (Canham et al. 1994, Gray and Spies 1996, Wright et al. 1998, Nicotra et al. 1999). Consequently, species, site, and age-related differences in the architecture of canopies have created a patterning of gaps that is highly variable across space and through time, leaving a complex mosaic of forest structure and light environments at many scales across the landscape (Lertzman et al. 1996, Trichon et al. 1998, Frazer et al. 1999). Interest in documenting the relationships between forest structure and the understory light regime has converged on a few methodological approaches from two distinct lines of research. On the one hand, community and population ecologists associated with studying successional processes canopy gaps formed by patchy tree-mortality needed to quantify the environmental conditions associated with those gaps (Rich et al. 1993, Canham et al. 1994, Easter and Spies 1994). On the other, microclimatologists and production ecologists required easily replicated and non-destructive methods for quantifying the leaf area borne by forest stands (Chen et al. 1997). of interest — for In both cases, the challenges and constraints of direct measurement of the variables instance, multiple light sensors running over several seasons or direct destructive sampling of tree crowns — led to the development of faster, less direct methods, which lend themselves more easily to spatial and temporal replication (Welles and Cohen 1996). Hemispherical canopy photography is one indirect optical technique that has been widely used in studies of canopy structure and forest light transmission. Photographs taken skyward from the forest floor with a 180o hemispherical (fisheye) lens produce circular images that record the size, shape, and location of gaps in the forest overstory. Digital scanners or cameras convert these hemispherical images into bitmaps, which are then analyzed using specialized image analysis software. Image processing involves the transformation of image pixel positions into angular coordinates, the division of pixel intensities into sky and non-sky classes, and the computation of sky-brightness distributions. These data are subsequently combined to produce estimates of growing-season light transmission, as well as other measures more directly related to canopy structure, such as openness, leaf area, and sunfleck frequency (Chazdon and Field 1987, Becker et al. 1989, Rich 1990, Canham 1995, ter Steege 1996).},

Two-year-old containerized seedlings of spruce was browsed more than 4-yr-old bare-rooted spruce. In 1991, browsing was more equal among species and seedling types. Number of seedlings with their leader browsed and the amount of biomass left after browsing differed significantly between seedling types.

This is particularly true for browsing ungulates due to the challenges in observing shy subjects in forested environments of low visibility. As a consequence we know relatively little about resource use by diverse browsing ungulates. When browsing, ungulates leave behind saliva on the browsed twig that includes their DNA, which can be used to identify the species that was responsible for browsing the twig. We used this method, which we term “biteDNA”, to study bite-scale browsing patterns in a temperate ungulate community. This approach provides a level of detail in browsing patterns across species that was previously very hard to attain. We found that all deer species largely overlapped in terms of the tree species they used. Moose browsed larger diameters than red deer and roe deer, but these latter two species did not differ. Moose browsed at higher heights than red deer, and red deer higher than roe deer. Although the deer species differed in mean browsing height, species were comparable in terms of their minimum browsing height of ~20 cm. This means that height and diameter ranges of the smaller species were found to be completely inside the ranges of the larger species. Hence, while moose may access exclusive food resources in terms of browse height and diameter, red and roe deer cannot.},

Data on tree responses were collected yearly during this period, as well as in 2011, and were analyzed using ordination techniques and generalized linear models. A key result demonstrated is the serious effects of clipping on the youngest pines. Mortality was high when clipping started the first year, indicating that the trees are vulnerable at that stage, but after that increasing intensity and duration of clipping were the main causes of mortality. Among the different treatment factors, intensity of clipping had the largest influence on altering the final growth responses, some of the quality responses, and mortality. Timing of clipping was the most important factor for explaining the occurrence of the majority of responses related to stem structure. Duration of clipping had the largest effect on the responses that included repeated-measures data, such as height development and number of stems.

In our study, the acorn density, the presence and intensity of the rooting were measured monthly in a 28-ha oak forest stand between 2016 October and 2019 April. Study site was divided to 400 m2 grid cells to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of the rooting. Comparing the acorn densities, we stated that in the first 2 years, but not in the third one, the oaks were masting. During the acorn-rich periods (October–April), significant inter-annual differences were found in the proportions of the disturbed area between the non-mast and the other two mast years. Throughout our observations, 9.12% of the cells stayed undisturbed. On average, in 12.59% of the cells new rooted patches appeared, and 15.6% of them was repeatedly disturbed. Rooting were mainly litter disturbances in 71.75% of cases. Throughout acorn fall periods (September–November), the most intensively rooted sites were the poorest in acorns, while the unrooted sites were the richest. Our results demonstrate that wild boars have a great effect on acorn density and on the whole forest by rooting almost the entire ground surface at least once, but also the masting of the oaks has a crucial role in their rooting dynamics.},

Cross-validation, involving repeated splits of each data set into training and validation subsets, was used to obtain honest estimates of predictive ability that could be fairly compared among methods. There was surprisingly little difference in predictive ability among five methods based on multiple linear regression. Stepwise methods performed similarly to exhaustive algorithms for subset selection, and the choice of criterion for comparing models (Akaike's information criterion, Schwarz's Bayesian information criterion or F statistics) had little effect on predictive ability. For most of the data sets, two methods based on regression trees yielded models with substantially lower predictive ability. I argue that there is no 'best' method of variable selection and that any of the regression-based approaches discussed here is capable of yielding useful predictive models. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

Browsing was highly seasonal in occurrence, being rare in winter and most frequent in early summer. This seasonal pattern varied between tree species - cherry and rowan were browsed earlier than oak and sweet chestnut. The probability of browsing was also influenced by the previous browsing history of a tree; trees that were browsed in one month were more prone to browsing subsequently. Trees browsed in year 1 were also more likely to be browsed the following year. Browsing was also related to the extent of budding of individual trees, with trees that were in leaf being more prone to damage than those without leaves erupted.},

   abstract = {By tracking oak-hickory (Quercus-Carya) regeneration for 13 yr across management-manipulated light and topographically driven moisture gradients after partial harvest and three prescribed fires, we document best-case conditions to promote advanced oak regeneration, and thereby provide a promising management tool to reverse the downward spiral in oak that plagues much of the Central Hardwoods within the eastern United States. This study was established in 2000 to assess regeneration following prescribed fire (spring of 2001, 2005, and 2010) in combination with partial harvest (late 2000) across two sites in southern Ohio. Each of the four 20+ ha treatment units (two partial harvest and burn, two controls) were modeled and mapped for long-term moisture regime using the Integrated Moisture Index (IMI) , and a 50-m grid of sampling points established throughout the units. Vegetation and light were sampled at each gridpoint before and after treatments, in 2000, 2001, 2004, 2006, 2009, and 2013. The partial harvest and burn treatments generally had more light which resulted in an increased number of oak stems. The fires promoted heterogeneity (pyrodiversity) in tree mortality and light availability, and consequently oakhickory regeneration, mostly following IMI patterns with the drier portions of the landscape having more fire, more light penetration, and greater regeneration compared to moist locations. Several other species also had marked variations in numbers and size throughout this period, depending on landscape variation in fire intensity and moisture regimes. These included Acer rubrum and Liriodendron tulipifera which expanded initially then collapsed after repeated fire, and Sassafras albidum which continued to flourish on dry sites. Based on this study, we recommend for topographically appropriate dry and intermediate sites, a partial harvest followed by two or three dormant-season fires (depending on fire intensity) allowing roughly 6-18% light to penetrate the forest floor. This will promote oak-hickory into the advanced oak regeneration status. Then, following a hiatus from burning for some years to further advance oak-hickory growth without topkill, some proportion of oaks and hickories can be expected to advance to the canopy following natural disturbance or harvest of current canopy. On mesic sites, though treatments demonstrated here do improve oak-hickory regeneration, the relative cost to benefit would be high.},

   abstract = {The shift from natural mixed broadleaved forests to pure coniferous plantations results in soil degradation and the unsustainable development of plantations due to the simple stand structure and low species diversity. Thinning can practically sustain the forest structure and promote the regeneration and growth of broadleaved trees in these pure coniferous plantations. The growth of regenerated broadleaved trees is closely related to leaf ecological stoichiometry, which is strongly restricted by environmental factors such as light, soil moisture, and nutrients after thinning. However, the temporal eects of thinning on leaf C:N:P stoichiometry are still not well understood, which constrains our understanding of implementing thinning in coniferous plantations to promote the regeneration and growth of broadleaved species, and further forming the mixed larch-broadleaf forests. Here, we compared canopy openness (i.e., light availability) and the soil and leaf stoichiometry for regenerated broadleaved trees in larch (Larix keampferi) plantations in short-term (1-3 years), medium-term (4-9 years), and long-term (≥10 years) periods after thinning, taking natural mixed broadleaved forests as a control in Northeast China. The results showed that the temporal eects of thinning were not significant with respect to soil C concentrations, but significant with respect to soil C:P and N:P ratios. The regenerated broadleaved trees adjusted their leaf N concentrations and C:N ratios in response to the changed environmental conditions after thinning over time. The responses of soil and leaf stoichiometry to thinning and their significant correlation indicated a strong interaction between the soil and understory regeneration following thinning. Thus, thinning aects the soil and leaf stoichiometry of regenerated trees over time. These findings provide new insights into the conversion of pure coniferous plantations into mixed larch-broadleaf forests by controlling thinning intervals.},

   abstract = {In Fennoscandia, young stands of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) are intensively used by moose (Alces alces L.) during winter. We studied whether forage amounts on high-cut pines in high-stump commercial thinning influenced browsing intensity and damage incidence on retained (i.e. uncut) pine stems. High-cut pines were browsed, but to a lesser extent than retained pines. At a scale corresponding to individual feeding sites (≈40 m2), browsing intensity on retained pines was not influenced by the amount of forage on high-cut pines but was positively related to moose pellet group counts. The incidence of lower-height damage (stem breakage and bark stripping) was positively related to the amount of forage on high-cut pines, whereas higher damage (leader shoot browsing) was not. Overall browsing damage incidence on retained pines was positively related to the density of deciduous trees and negatively related to the amount of forage on retained pines. Our results suggest that although high-stump thinning supplies additional food resources for moose, larger amounts of forage on high-cut pines may increase the risk for bark stripping and stem breakage on retained trees. Further research is needed at larger spatial scales to assess the feasibility of high-stump thinning as a damage mitigation measure.},

   abstract = {In a large-scale survey, comprising 38 landscapes throughout Sweden, we measured winter forage availability and use by moose within different forest- and land types, and also at three different spatial scales: plot, tract and area. Measured as percent cover of browse species within moose browsing range, young forests contained significantly more browse (16.5 ± 1.20%: mean ± SE) compared with older forests (6.7 ± 0.57%) or non-forest land (5.9 ± 0.67%). Total cover of browse species increased with increasing mean tree height in forests, and peaked at around 22% when the trees were 3–5 m. The relative consumption was highest in young forests (9.2 ± 0.98%) compared with non-forest land (7.8 ± 1.40%) or older forests (5.8 ± 0.78%). The selection order did not vary much among forest- or land types, with aspen, willows, rowan and oak being the most selected species. A multiple regression, including four independent variables (moose index, cover of Scots pine, cover of other species and temperature sum) explained 45% (young forests), 18% (older forests) and 36% (non-forest land) of the variation in relative consumption. In young forests, moose index and cover of Scots pine accounted for 40 and 44%, respectively, of the explained variation. Model selection, using AICc, further emphasized the importance of moose index and cover of Scots pine, as these variables were included in the most parsimonious models for all forest- and land types. At the tract level, we recorded a proportional relationship between total cover of browse species and absolute consumption, suggesting an ideal free distribution. Taking into account the availability of forage, the degree of browsing and the proportion of each land type in the landscape, we calculated that 44.3% of the total forage consumption occurred in young forests, 42.3% in older forests and 13.4% in non-forest land. Our main conclusions are that moose conform to an ideal free distribution based on availability of forage within the landscape, and that all forest- and land types, not just young forests, are important as sources of browse for moose. Thus, it may be possible to release the browsing pressure on damage-sensitive young forests by increasing the food supply in other forest- and land types. Furthermore, managers needs to consider both the size of the moose population and the amounts of browse in the landscape when deciding on prudent management actions.},

   abstract = {Management in fire-prone ecosystems relies widely upon application of prescribed fire and/or fire-surrogate (e.g., forest thinning) treatments to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem function. The literature suggests fire and mechanical treatments proved more variable in their effects on understory vegetation as compared to their effects on stand structure. The growing body of work comparing fire and thinning effects on understory vegetation offers an opportunity to increase the generality of conclusions through meta-analysis. We conducted a meta-analysis to determine if there were consistent responses of understory vegetation to these treatments in North American forests that historically experienced frequent surface fire regimes (<20 years fire return interval, FRI). Means and standard errors were extracted from 32 papers containing data on the response of four understory functional groups (herbaceous, shrub, non-native, and total) to thinning and burning treatments to calculate effect sizes. Lack of replication and inconsistent reporting of results hindered our ability to include many studies in this analysis. For each response variable (species richness and percent cover), we compared three treatment pairs: burn vs control, thin vs control and thin vs burn. We calculated standardized mean differences (Hedges’ g) for each pair and tested if this differed from zero using a random effects model fit with restricted maximum likelihood to account for variation by site. The most consistent effect of the treatments was the increase in non-native species following mechanical thinning and reduction in shrub cover following a burn. These differences suggest the two treatments may not be surrogates in the short-term (less than 5 years). Increase of non-native species due to disturbance is well established but it is not clear if burning and thinning consistently have differential impacts. Response of non-native plants to disturbance is likely a complex function of a variety of site and landscape factors that cannot be evaluated by the current literature. We conclude that prescribed fire and thinning treatments can be used successfully to restore understory species richness and cover, but they can create different conditions and these potentially different outcomes need to be considered in the planning of a fuels reduction treatment. We discuss management options to reduce negative effects of the treatments and we suggest managers use current decision-making frameworks prior to designing an intervention.},

   abstract = {Increased fire severity in boreal forests of Interior Alaska is shifting forest canopy composition from black spruce (Picea mariana) to deciduous species, including trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and Alaska paper birch (Betula neoalaskana). Because deciduous trees are less flammable than black spruce, the dominant disturbance regime in deciduous forests could move away from fire to one of gap disturbances. In this study, we quantified forest gap characteristics and vegetation within eight mature (62–119-yr-old) deciduous stands in Interior Alaska. Canopy gaps were generally small (true gap area <50 m2), formed by the mortality of 4–16 gap makers (which were always deciduous trees), and occupied ∼17–29% of the forest except in the oldest stand, where gap fraction exceeded 45%, and in one anomalous 84-yr old stand, where gaps were absent. Canopy openness increased linearly with gap area, but density of both deciduous and evergreen tree recruits was generally low and insufficient to create future stands with densities similar to those currently found in mature stands across the landscape. Canopy openness was instead correlated with decreased leaf litter cover and increased cover of moss, lichen, and evergreen shrubs. Given the low recruitment of trees with canopy gaps and the decreased probability of fire, deciduous stands will likely transition to non-forested areas or low density stands once overstory trees reach maturity and die. This could have numerous implications for ecosystem function, including carbon (C), water, and energy balance, and potential feedbacks to future fire occurrence and regional climate.},

   abstract = {Background: Plant strategies to resist herbivory include tolerance and avoidance. Tolerance strategies, such as rapid regrowth which increases the palatability of new shoots, can lead to positive feedback loops between plants and herbivores. An example of such a positive feedback occurs when moose (Alces alces) browse trees in boreal forests. We described the degree of change in tree morphology that accumulated over time in response to repeated browsing by moose, using an index of accumulated browsing. We evaluated whether accumulated browsing could predict the probability and extent of current browsing across woody species in a Norwegian boreal forest, and how our accumulated browsing index related to changes in tree height, shoot availability and shoot size. Results: The probability and extent of current browsing increased with the degree of accumulated browsing in all tree species. Plants highly modified by previous browsing were the most attractive, with no indication of decreased preference with repeated browsing over time. The preference for previously browsed trees is most likely driven by increased relative availability of shoots within browsing height and maybe increased palatability. This response to previous browsing was general for both preferred and avoided forage species, in both conifers and deciduous trees. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the adaptation for rapid regrowth after browsing does not reduce herbivory on trees. Rather, our results indicate that plant responses to browsing increase the probability of future herbivory. This response could potentially lead to higher plant mortality where cervid populations are maintained at stable high densities and has implications for plant population dynamics and forestry practices.},

   abstract = {The optimal foraging theory, the nutrient balance hypothesis, and the plant association theories predict that foraging decisions and resulting tree damage by large mammalian browsers may be influenced by the species richness and species composition of forest stands. This may lead to either associational susceptibility (increased damage on a focal plant in a mixed stand) or associational resistance (reduced damage in a mixed stand). Better understanding of the mechanisms and the relative importance of tree species richness and composition effects on foraging by mammalian browsers is needed to support sustainable management of forests and mammal populations. However, existing knowledge of forest diversity effects on foraging by large mammalian browsers comes largely from observational studies while experimental evidence is limited. We analysed winter browsing by moose (Alces alces L.) in a long-term, large-scale experiment in Finland, which represents a tree species richness gradient from monocultures to 2-, 3- and 5-species mixtures composed of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies L.), Siberian larch (Larix sibirica Ledeb.), silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.) and black alder (Alnus glutinosa L.). The intensity of browsing per plot increased with tree species richness while browsing selectivity decreased with tree species being targeted more equally in species-rich mixtures. Tree species composition of a plot was also an important determinant of intensity of browsing. The greatest browsing occurred in plots containing preferred species (pine and birch) while intermediate preference species (larch and alder) experienced associational susceptibility when growing with pine and birch compared with their monocultures or mixtures without pine and birch. In contrast, we found no evidence of associational resistance; the presence of a least preferred species (spruce) in a mixture had no significant effect on moose browsing on other tree species. We demonstrate that the presence of alternative forage species allows moose to spend longer opportunistically foraging in a plot, resulting in increased level of damage in species-rich stands and stands containing preferred tree species. Our results highlight the limitations of the optimal foraging theory in predicting browsing patterns and demonstrate the importance of associational effects within mixed stands. © 2013 British Ecological Society.},

Rooting phenology was dominated by superficial rooting in the litter layer, with highest frequencies in deciduous forests. Mast availability increased rooting activities in winter and summer, but the effects of season, soil morphology, or root abundance could not be established. No effect of rooting on soil pH, organic matter, and N-contents could be established. No evidence was found that singular, very intensive rooting, resulting in mixture of soil horizons, favoured conditions for germination and growth in stands of beech (Fagus sylvestris), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi), and pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). In practice, the boar visited the same spots regularly, and no effect of rooting could be established on regeneration of European black cherry (Prunus padus), American black cherry (P. serotina), birch (Betula pubescens and B. pendula), rowan (Sorbus aucuparia), holly (Ilex aquifolium), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Douglas-fir, Norway spruce (Picea abies), and Japanese larch.

   abstract = {Ungulate populations across Europe have been strongly increasing over the past decades. Simultaneously with this increase, concerns about the impact of ungulates on forest systems, and forestry specifically, are increasing. In this study we discuss how the common forestry practice of creating clear cuts in relatively homogenous, managed forests may increase the potential impact of ungulates. Growth of trees in full light conditions is generally higher, but due to higher photosynthetic activity they tend to have higher C:N ratio in their leaves thus decreasing food quality. Next to that, biomass of herbaceous vegetation is enhanced in clear cuts. These changes likely affect foraging decisions of ungulates and it has been suggested that ungulates forage in forest gaps rather than in closed forest. We tested this hypothesis by using an experimental approach. The experiment was conducted in the Białowieża Primeval Forest in Poland, where a full assemblage of native large herbivores occurs. Six plots (6 m × 6 m) inside small clear cuts were compared to six control plots in adjacent closed forest. To exclude the effect of differences in number and species composition of available tree saplings, equal numbers of trees saplings of five species were planted at each plot. Ungulate visitation frequency and visitation time were measured by means of three methods: track plots, camera- and video trapping, and pellet counts. Visitation frequency of all ungulates combined (European bison, red deer, roe deer, moose and wild boar) was almost twice as high inside forest gaps compared to closed forest. Also cumulative visitation time by all ungulates tended to be higher inside forest gaps. Red deer showed the strongest preference for gaps, and duration of single visits was almost seven times longer for forest gaps than in closed forest. The observed preferential foraging of ungulates in forest gaps leads to an uneven distribution of their browsing behaviour. Hence, the creation of forest gaps by clear cutting followed by reforestation provides attractive foraging patches for ungulates potentially leading to high damage. In this way, forestry practices may enhance damage of ungulates to plantations especially when due to management the surrounding forest has a low carrying capacity for ungulates. We suggest that there is much to gain if management approaches would focus at influencing foraging behaviour of ungulates and reduce their concentration in forest gaps, rather than purely focusing on population control. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {An overview is presented of the silviculture of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L) and sessile oak (Q petraea Liebl.) in Germany. This presentation is confined to less dry to moist and stagnic gleysol sites, where the intention is to produce primary timbers in long rotation periods. Incorporation of a shade tolerant species as an admixture species is indispensable to the suppression of epicormic branches. The most frequent and recommended admixture species for this purpose is beech (Fagus sylvatica L). Because beech is competitively stronger than the oaks on these sites, silvicultural measures must be taken to keep it in check. According to the classic silviculture which has taken shape in the Spessart and Pfalzer forests, the desired goal of a two-storeyed stand with oak in the overstorey and beech in the understorey is achieved by means of heavy seeding beneath an open and rapidly cleared canopy. Because this procedure resembles clear cutting and entails its recognized disadvantages, trials have recently been undertaken to regenerate oaks in a silviculture with permanent canopy cover. Trials with young oaks show that they still achieve satisfactory growth at 15-20% of full light. Accordingly, successful regeneration is possible in beech stands under an open canopy or in gaps, and under an approximately closed canopy cover in pine stands due to their more penetrable crowns. The problematic aspect of this, especially in beech stands, is that young beeches become competitively stronger than oaks as canopy cover increases. This requires great effort in restraining the beech during cleanings and thinnings. Furthermore, browsing by wild animals must be minimized as it exclusively affects oak. As a result, however, there will be significantly fewer oaks and more beeches in the dominant layer than when using classic methods.},

   abstract = {Wild boar Sus scrofa L. rooting is a large and frequent disturbance, very extended all over the world. However, its impact in some sensitive habitats, such as alpine and subalpine grasslands remains unknown. These grasslands are considered important sites for biological conservation and traditional grazing activities, and are frequently affected by wild boar rootings. In this study, we selected three study sites representing a range of scenarios in Pyrenean alpine and subalpine grasslands, with differing protection status and grazing management. We assessed the extent of wild boar rooting, and determined the main variables that influence their distribution, taking into account the interactions among them. Our results showed that wild boar rooting significantly affected alpine and subalpine grasslands in the Pyrenees especially in protected non-hunting areas (up to 12% of the surface). The distribution of disturbed areas was influenced by a hierarchical suite of variables, among which vegetation, that is certain plant communities, was the most important. The apparent preference for dense grasslands might be associated with its soil depth, soil hardness and diversity of feeding resources. The importance of other variables, such as topography, distance to primary resources or grazing management, was site dependent. A broad understanding of the effects of variables and their relationships provide insights into the actual factors affecting the rooting selection. We hypothesize that the selection of feeding habitat, followed by the conditions of the soil to be uprooted and human management, are the main underlying factors that shape the distribution of wild boar rooting in alpine and subalpine grasslands. © 2009 The Zoological Society of London.},

   abstract = {Forest and livestock management puts pressure on forests and the wildlife they support. Although many species may be negatively affected by these human activities, the abundance of other species may be promoted, although this has perhaps received less attention in livestock, logging, and conservation management plans. Wild boar and red fox, two common mammals distributed throughout Europe, occupy a wide variety of Mediterranean environments. Little is known about how increases in logging and livestock management have changed their status. This work models the response of wild boar and red fox to these pressures in the human-altered Mediterranean forest landscapes of the central Iberian Peninsula (NHR), where the predominant land uses in the last hundred years have focused on livestock and logging (thinning and selective cutting). We collapsed land use and habitat structure variables into independent habitat vectors using principle component analysis (PCA) and then used a general linear model (GLM) to explain the relationships between red fox and wild boar abundance and the independent habitat vectors observed in human-altered forests. Livestock and logging activity was positively correlated with wild boar abundance, and negatively correlated with red fox abundance, although red fox tolerated open scrubland that had been logged. Red fox abundance remained negatively correlated with the same variables when boar abundance was added as an environmental predictor in the model, but some additional variance was explained, demonstrating the need to include indirect interspecific relationships in the habitat-species models. The combined effects of wild boar, logging and livestock are indirectly important factors which modify habitat structure and negatively affect red fox. Therefore, common mammal species are influenced by livestock and logging in different ways which necessarily may be taken into account in management and conservation decisions in Mediterranean human-altered forests. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Three species of deciduous trees (quaking aspen, Populus tremuloides; paper birch, Betula papyrifera; sugar maple, Acer saccharum) were grown under ambient (387 ± 8 μL/L) and elevated (696 ± 2 μL/L) levels of atmospheric CO2, with low and high light availability (375 and 855 μmol x m-2 x s-1 at solar noon). Effects on the population and individual performance of a generalist phytophagous insect, the white-marked tussock moth (Orgyia leucostigma) were evaluated. Caterpillars were reared on experimental trees for the duration of the larval stage, and complementary short-term (fourth instar) feeding trials were conducted with insects fed detached leaves. Phytochemical analyses demonstrated strong effects of both CO2 and light on all foliar nutritional variables (water, starch and nitrogen). For all species, enriched CO2 decreased water content and increased starch content, especially under high light conditions. High CO2 availability reduced levels of foliar nitrogen, but effects were species specific and most pronounced for high light aspen and birch. Analyses of secondary plant compounds revealed that levels of phenolic glycosides (salicortin and tremulacin) in aspen and condensed tannins in birch and maple were positively influenced by levels of both CO2 and light. In contrast, levels of condensed tannins in aspen were primarily affected by light, whereas levels of ellagitannins and gallotannins in maple responded to light and CO2, respectively. The long-term bioassays showed strong treatment effects on survival, development time, and pupal mass. In general, CO2 effects were pronounced in high light and decreased along the gradient aspen > birch > maple. For larvae reared on high light aspen, enriched CO2 resulted in 62% fewer survivors, with increased development time, and reduced pupal mass. For maple-fed insects, elevated CO2 levels had negative effects on survival and pupal mass in low light. For birch, the only negative CO2 effects were observed in high light, where female larvae showed prolonged development. Fourth instar feeding trials demonstrated that low food conversion efficiency reduced insect performance. Elevated levels of CO2 significantly reduced total consumption, especially by insects on high light aspen and low light maple. This research demonstrates that effects of CO2 on phytochemistry and insect performance can be strongly light-dependent, and that plant responses to these two environmental variables differ among species. Overall, increased CO2 availability appeared to increase the defensive capacity of early-successional species primarily under high light conditions, and of late-successional species under low light conditions. Due to the interactive effects of tree species, light, CO2, and herbivory, community composition of forests may change in the future.},

   abstract = {Moose is a major cause of damage in young plantations of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) in Finland, as they break stems and browse twigs and leaves. Damage by moose was measured in a provenance trial of silver birch situated at Loppi, southern Finland. The trial includes stand seed origins from Finland, Sweden, Estonia, Scotland and Russia, ranging in latitudes from 53° to 67°. The trial was established on a typical, southern Finnish moist upland clear-cut area that had been protected against moose by fencing. After the break-down of the fence, at the age of 5-11 years, the trial was frequently visited by moose. The effects of browsing were measured in early spring 2001, when the trees were 11 years old. The average proportion of trees browsed by moose varied between 6 and 86% among the seed origins. Browsing by moose decreased with increasing latitude of seed origin and sapling height. Seed origins transferred from more southern latitudes (southern Estonia, southern Sweden, Scotland, Russia) had a higher proportion of browsed trees than the more northern native ones. A similar pattern was also seen in the proportion of trees with stem breakage and the proportion of repeatedly browsed trees. Latitude of seed origin and sapling height covariate had a significant effect on moose browsing. The moose browsed more branches per browsed tree of southern origins, whereas sapling height had no significant effect. It is suggested that the variation in moose browsing among the seed origins was related to differences in their annual physiological rhythm, i.e. timing of growth cessation, leaf discoloration and abscission, and related changes in digestibility and palatability. It was concluded that importing birch regeneration material to Finland from more southern latitudes should be avoided because of the risk of browsing damage. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Local climate and ungulate browsing are two major factors that affect tree regeneration and genetic adaptation in Central European forests. Owing to climate change and increasing ungulate numbers, the abiotic and biotic environments of trees are changing remarkably, making it necessary to investigate the separate and joint effects of seed source (i.e., location of tree population origin) and ungulate herbivory. We used a common garden experiment to study the growth and morphology of Fagus sylvatica saplings from 77 Swiss seed sources. The experiment was set up at two sites and included a clipping treatment (i.e., terminal shoot clipped at two intensities) applied before budburst to simulate winter ungulate browsing. We studied F. sylvatica sapling growth and morphology before and two years after clipping. Measured growth traits included sapling height, stem diameter, and biomass. Morphological traits included multi-stemming, stem and crown form, stem quality, and reaction to clipping. Seed source, test site, and simulated leader browsing were all important in determining the growth and quality of F. sylvatica saplings. The effects of seed source on growth and quality indicate that F. sylvatica possesses a large pool of diverse genotypes across Switzerland and thus has the potential to adapt to local conditions through gene flow. Growth and morphology differed significantly between the two test sites, indicating that local environments should be considered carefully when a new plantation is established. The effect of the single simulated browsing event disappeared over time for the growth traits, owing to growth compensation. However, sapling quality decreased after clipping, suggesting that browsing may lead to persistent quality losses in production forests. Neither the growth nor the morphological reaction after clipping depended on the effect of population, meaning that resilience to browsing was independent of seed source. Consequently, interactions with ungulate browsing do not have to be taken into account when selecting F. sylvatica populations for particular climatic and site conditions.},

   abstract = {Plants employ a range of resistance and tolerance mechanisms to counteract the effects of herbivory and research is still unravelling which strategies are most effective against which herbivores. In commercial forestry, research has focused on understanding the genetic basis of resistance traits and using resistance as a management strategy. However, there has been less focus on addressing the basis and utility of tolerance traits. Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) is a well-studied forest tree due to its wide distribution, commercial importance and use in forest restoration of degraded lands as an important foundation tree species. Several herbivore species browse Scots pine and, here, we examine the genetic basis of recovery of Scots pine saplings following browsing by red deer (Cervus elaphus) and attempt to describe which plant traits are associated with sapling tolerance. Three hundred saplings from five different open pollinated mothers (five families) were offered to deer in a feeding trial and saplings were left to recover from browsing for one and a half years (two annual growth seasons) in a randomised, replicated common garden. Seven sapling traits were assessed at this time: survival, stem diameter below the leading bud, stem diameter at the base of the sapling, total sapling height, length of the leading bud, average length of three lateral buds, and the total number of lateral buds. Results indicate that browsing of Scots pine by deer influences sapling survival and recovery ability. There were significant family differences in morphological growth traits and these differences were maintained in the presence and absence of browsing. For one recovery trait, length of the leading bud, overcompensation in response to browsing was evident in all families. These data, matched with our finding of no negative relationships between any recovery traits, indicate that Scots pine is quite robust to once-off browsing events by deer. We suggest that at the sapling stage, Scots pine do not employ resistance as a strategy against deer, but tolerate deer browsing to counteract the negative impacts of herbivory. Hence, the use of recovery traits as a management tool to mitigate the negative impacts of browsing is an option worthy of further investigation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Quantitative genetically based traits in dominant and keystone tree species can have extended effects on other biota and also on ecosystem processes. This has direct implications for managed plant systems, where choice of genetic stock in conservation or commercial plantings will affect the ecological and evolutionary trajectory of the associated biotic communities. Hence an understanding of genetic variation in quantitative traits, especially those that relate directly to fitness, should be incorporated into the management of species. In plants, quantitative traits such as foliar defences that mediate the complexity of biotic interactions (e.g. herbivory), may be key fitness traits to consider in the management of gene pools of species that are of high conservation value. In this paper we examine the interactions of an endangered eucalypt species, Eucalyptus morrisbyi and a marsupial herbivore, the common brushtail possum Trichosurus vulpecula. We investigate the genetic variability of resistance of plants sourced from two populations and genetic variability in foliage defences as key quantitative traits that may be essential for survival of this eucalypt species. Trichosurus vulpecula detect clear genetic divergence in the two E. morrisbyi populations as evidenced by their browsing preferences in the field. In addition, trees from the more susceptible population (Calverts Hill) suffered fitness consequences with lower flowering than trees from the more resistant population (Risdon Hills). Field feeding preferences were confirmed in captive feeding trials arguing differences were due to foliar attributes consistent with the genetic-based differences observed in key chemical and physical foliage traits. Biotic interactions such as herbivory may affect populations of rare plant species. Results of this study highlight the need to understand the degree of genetic differentiation of resistance to herbivores and in the quantitative traits mediating these interactions in species of high conservation value, as these traits affect the adaptive potential of populations. © 2011 The Authors.

   abstract = {Quercus robur L. (pedunculate oak) and Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl. (sessile oak) are two European oak species of great economic and ecological importance. Even though both oaks have wide ecological amplitudes of suitable growing conditions, forests dominated by oaks often fail to regenerate naturally. The regeneration performance of both oak species is assumed to be subject to a variety of variables that interact with one another in complex ways. The novel approach of this research was to study the effect of many ecological variables on the regeneration performance of both oak species together and identify key variables and interactions for different development stages of the oak regeneration on a large scale in the field. For this purpose, overstory and regeneration inventories were conducted in oak dominated forests throughout southern Germany and paired with data on browsing, soil, and light availability. The study was able to verify the assumption that the occurrence of oak regeneration depends on a set of variables and their interactions. Specifically, combinations of site and stand specific variables such as light availability, soil pH and iron content on the one hand, and basal area and species composition of the overstory on the other hand. Also browsing pressure was related to oak abundance. The results also show that the importance of variables and their combinations differs among the development stages of the regeneration. Light availability becomes more important during later development stages, whereas the number of oaks in the overstory is important during early development stages. We conclude that successful natural oak regeneration is more likely to be achieved on sites with lower fertility and requires constantly controlling overstory density. Initially sufficient mature oaks in the overstory should be ensured. In later stages, overstory density should be reduced continuously to meet the increasing light demand of oak seedlings and saplings. Copyright:},

   abstract = {Ecological, economic, and social demands triggered a shift in the management of temperate deciduous forests from rotation forestry system towards more nature-based forest management techniques such as continuous cover forestry. However, there is insufficient knowledge on the regeneration success of different tree species—especially oaks—within this management system. Through a systematic experiment, we compared the regeneration processes of a sessile oak-hornbeam forest after gap-cutting (as an element of continuous cover forestry system) to regeneration after clear-cutting, preparation cutting, and in retention tree groups (treatments of rotation forestry system). A managed, closed, mature forest was used as control. Several different aspects of the regeneration were studied: (1) seed supply of sessile oak—Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl., (2) species number and abundance of the natural regeneration, (3) survival and growth of individual saplings of five tree species (sessile and Turkey oak—Quercus cerris L., hornbeam—Carpinus betulus L., beech—Fagus sylvatica L., and common ash—Fraxinus excelsior L.). The number of acorns was high in closed forest, intermediate in preparation cutting and retention tree group, low in gaps, and zero in clear-cutting. Four years after the interventions, there was no detectable treatment effect on the species number of regeneration. Survival increased in every treatment compared to control, but there was no significant difference in this measure between the differently treated sites. Height growth was highest in the gaps and clear-cuts, intermediate in preparation cuts, and lowest in retention tree groups and controls. Species with different seed dispersal mechanisms responded differently to treatments: oaks were dispersal-limited in the gaps and clear-cuts, while anemochorous species (e.g., hornbeam and manna ash) were present in every treatment. The survival and growth pattern of the particular species proved to be similar, but the intensity of the response differed: shade-tolerants (hornbeam, beech, and ash) showed better survival than oaks in most treatments, and their height growth was larger. According to our results, oak regeneration establishes successfully in oak-hornbeam forests not only in the case of rotation forestry, but also during continuous cover forestry (gap-cutting). The survival and growth of the saplings are similar in cutting areas and gaps, but keeping in mind other considerations (such as preserving forest continuity, balanced site conditions, and forest biodiversity), continuous cover forestry should be preferred.},

Using FIA data, our work formally quantifies the change in oak abundance in the eastern U.S. during the period of 1980-2008. The results indicate that most areas in the eastern U.S. experienced some decline in oak abundance, but the decrease was not universal either geographically or among species. Declines were especially marked in the Central Hardwood Region, which lost oak abundance on 81% its forested area as measured by importance value (IV). Areas with a high oak abundance were more likely to see a reduction in abundance. Among all 25 species analyzed, eight species decreased significantly in IV while two increased. Both the top two most prevalent white oak species (white oak (Quercus alba) and post oak (Quercus stellata)) and red oak species (northern red oak (Quercus rubra) and black oak (Quercus velutina)) had significant decreases in density and IV. Water oak (Quercus nigra) is one of the red oak species that had a near universal increase of its abundance throughout its native range (83% of area). This study provided a comprehensive quantification of the dynamic of oak species in a regional-wide geographic context, which will provoke forest researchers and managers to revisit the oak decline problem by using knowledge from other regions and other species. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Many tree species worldwide are suffering from slow or failed natural regeneration with dramatic consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, it is difficult to disentangle the complex effects of factors influencing regeneration processes on long-lived tree species at large scales. In this study, we use long-term data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory (1953–2015) combined with deer hunting data (1960–2015) to reveal experimentally-intractable processes impeding oak (Quercus spp.) regeneration in southern Sweden. Oak-dominated ecosystems are widespread in northern temperate regions, where oaks are foundation species with disproportionate importance for biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Our study reveals that during the last six decades, oak tree numbers and standing volume have continuously increased, while natural regeneration of oak declined steeply after the early 1980s. We connect this decline to denser and darker forests, combined with increased abundance of deer. Land use changes during the six decades, such as abandonment of traditional practices and large-scale introduction of forest management oriented towards high volume production, led to continuously denser forests and thereby reduced the oak regeneration niche. In addition, the impact of changed game management was evident. This was particularly clear from a natural experiment on Gotland, a large island free of deer until roe deer were introduced in the late 20th century, at which point oak regeneration began a steep decline. At the stand level, natural oak regeneration could be expected to mainly occur in pulses after disturbance events, followed by a period of low regeneration success as the cohort ages. However, at a landscape scale one would expect a mix of successional stages that would even out such demographic patterns. A prolonged period of low regeneration at a landscape scale will eventually lead to a large gap in the oak size distribution as was observed in this study. This could eventually hurt the many species dependent on old and large oak trees. Active management to restore the oak regeneration niche, i.e. forest habitats with more light and less browsing pressure, therefore seems essential. The latter includes developing strategies that manage both deer populations and their available food across landscapes. Our study is the first to link oak regeneration failure to long-term changes in land use and increased deer populations at a landscape scale in this region. Furthermore, our study show how historical data can clarify confounded processes impacting long-lived forest species.},

   abstract = {The response of an ecosystem to disturbance reflects its stability, which is determined by two components: resistance and resilience. We addressed both components in a study of early post-fire response of natural broadleaved forest (Quercus robur, Ilex aquifolium) and pine plantation (Pinus pinaster, Pinus sylvestris) to a wildfire that burned over 6000. ha in NW Portugal. Fire resistance was assessed from fire severity, tree mortality and sapling persistence. Understory fire resistance was similar between forests: fire severity at the surface level was moderate to low, and sapling persistence was low. At the canopy level, fire severity was generally low in broadleaved forest but heterogeneous in pine forest, and mean tree mortality was significantly higher in pine forest. Forest resilience was assessed by the comparison of the understory composition, species diversity and seedling abundance in unburned and burned plots in each forest type. Unburned broadleaved communities were dominated by perennial herbs (e.g., Arrhenatherum elatius) and woody species (e.g., Hedera hibernica, Erica arborea), all able to regenerate vegetatively. Unburned pine communities presented a higher abundance of shrubs, and most dominant species relied on post-fire seeding, with some species also being able to regenerate vegetatively (e.g., Ulex minor, Daboecia cantabrica). There were no differences in diversity measures in broadleaved forest, but burned communities in pine forest shared less species and were less rich and diverse than unburned communities. Seedling abundance was similar in burned and unburned plots in both forests. The slower reestablishment of understory pine communities is probably explained by the slower recovery rate of dominant species. These findings are ecologically relevant: the higher resistance and resilience of native broadleaved forest implies a higher stability in the maintenance of forest processes and the delivery of ecosystem services. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

   abstract = {For millennia, natural disturbance regimes, including anthropogenic fire and hunting practices, have led to forest regeneration patterns that created a diversity of forest lands across the USA. But dramatic changes in climates, invasive species, and human population, and land use have created novel disturbance regimes that are causing challenges to securing desired natural regeneration. Climate is an ever-present background disturbance and determinant of species distribution. Changes in certain other factors such as large herbivore populations, wildfire, and pests modify forest composition and structure, and are common barriers to natural regeneration of desired species. Changes in long-standing disturbance regimes have led to the homogenization of forest landscape composition and structure. Today, forests have low regeneration potential and are low in resilience. They have reduced productivity and are prone to widespread health issues including severe forest mortality. In addition to epidemics of native invasive species due to climate change and availability of habitat at landscape scales, the continued introduction and spread of non-native pests and diseases are causing large-scale forest mortality. These ecological changes have cascading ecological consequences such as increases in severe wildfire, which pose new barriers to natural regeneration. Equally challenging are the barriers to natural regeneration that arise from social, political and economic factors. To address many of these issues requires active management that links all critical stages in the regeneration niche necessary for achieving desired regeneration to sustain forest development and production in a socially acceptable manner and economically viable market system.},

   abstract = {Current occurrence patterns of species associated with ancient trees may reflect higher historical habitat densities, because the dynamics of the habitat and the colonisation-extinction processes for many inhabiting species are expected to be slow. We tested this hypothesis in southeast Sweden by analysing species occurrence per parish for twelve redlisted lichen species and nine redlisted fungus species in relation with current density of big oaks, the density of oaks in the 1830s and connectivity with parishes with the species present. For most species, the occurrence was positively related with current density of habitat (for 18 species out of 21) and parish area (for 16 species). Historical habitat density was positively related with occurrence for 11 species, while connectivity with current occurrences in the surroundings was positive for the occurrence of 12 species and negative for the occurrence of two. For lichen species the connectivity measure that best explained the variation was at a larger spatial scale as compared to fungus species. Even if the density of old oaks remains in the future, inhabiting species will most likely decline because their distribution patterns are not in equilibrium with the current habitat density. Therefore, to allow long-term persistence of inhabiting species the number of old oaks should be increased. Areas where such an increase is most urgent could be identified based on species occurrence data and current habitat density, but because species data will always be incomplete data on the historical habitat distribution is valuable. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

   abstract = {To evaluate which qualities of dead wood have the highest conservational value for invertebrates, substrate requirements were recorded for all 542 saproxylic (wood-living) red-listed invertebrates in Sweden. Preferred qualities of dead trees were described for each species in seven category variables: tree species, stage of decay, type of main stem, coarseness of stem, part of tree, light preference and microhabitat. For each quality we quantified the number of red-listed insect species using it and the number that are specific to the quality. The number of species associated with different tree genera ranged from five to 202. Species-rich genera had a higher proportion of monophagous species. To what extent different tree genera have faunas complementary to each other was also analysed. As the wood decays, the host range broadens and the flora of decay fungi will probably take over as the most important factor determining the saproxylic fauna. Because there are many different types of rot required by different invertebrates, an abundance of similar looking dead trees, logs and snags are probably needed. Some 59% of the invertebrate species can live in sun-exposed sites. Most of these are favoured when the forest burns and at least 29 of them are more strongly associated with fires. For the former category, leaving dead wood on clear cuts should be an effective way to increase the amount of breeding substrate. However, some species, especially those living in the last successional stages, are dependent on shaded sites. Hollow tree trunks are another important microhabitat; 64 of the 107 species living there are specialists. To maintain all saproxylic species we need a diversity of substrate types and management methods. Our data can help to decide how to optimize the conservation measures taken during forest operations.},

   abstract = {The oak-dominated woodlands and forests of northern Europe have experienced dramatic declines due to agriculture, urbanization, and conifer-dominated production forestry. These losses have had a substantial negative impact on biodiversity due to the large number of forest species which depend on oak and the environments oak-dominated forests provide. Production oak stands may serve as a means of supplementing or complementing the habitat provided by the limited remaining natural oak remnants in this region. Here we evaluate the extent to which oak plantations in temperate southern Sweden provide habitat and resources for bird communities, by surveying and contrasting the bird species composition and diversity found in mature and young production oak stands (5 and 8 replicates respectively) and protected oak-dominated remnant forests (5 replicates). The mature production stands possessed a bird community partially overlapping in bird species composition, and comparable in species richness (34 species) to that found within protected oak forests (39 species). Furthermore, the production oak forests surveyed hosted threatened or near threatened bird species, including black woodpecker (Dryocopus martius), goldcrest (Regulus regulus), starling (Sturnus vulgaris), and yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella). Though production oak forests cannot replace the habitat provided by protected oak forests, these stands do appear to provide conditions consistent with the habitat and resource requirements of a diverse cross-section of bird species in this region, including species of substantial conservation concern. Production oak forests thus have the capacity to make a positive contribution to biodiversity conservation, as well as providing a diverse range of goods and services to society.},

   abstract = {Most coppice forests in Japan were abandoned in the 1960s for socio-economic reasons. In the last two decades, Quercus crispula and Quercus serrata, the main species in Japanese coppice forests, have suffered mortality from Japanese oak wilt disease (JOW) vectored by the ambrosia beetle Platypus quercivorus. To clarify forest changes due to secondary succession and JOW in abandoned coppice forests, stand dynamics over 23-26. years in 16 permanent plots in Toyama Prefecture, central Japan, were analyzed. Seven plots were beech-oak stands dominated by Fagus crenata and Q. crispula, and nine were oak stands dominated by Q. crispula (in five plots) and/or Q. serrata (in six plots). In beech-oak stands before the appearance of JOW, dominance of shade-tolerant F. crenata increased and that of less shade-tolerant Q. crispula decreased in all seven plots, as expected from process of secondary succession. Since 2005 when the incidence of JOW became noticeable, Q. crispula suffered high mortality rates, and basal area in 2013 decreased compared with the first measurement (1987-1990) in all 12 plots. In contrast, JOW had less impact on Q. serrata because of its low mortality rates with JOW. In beech-oak stands, F. crenata expanded in dominance because of secondary succession and subsequent JOW, and stands will develop into old-growth beech forests over the long term. In oak stands, shade-tolerant canopy species under dead oak trees, such as Acer sieboldianum, are expected to replace dead oak trees, but understory species might also increase and slow the growth of saplings and seedlings of canopy tree species. Regeneration of oak was inferred to be difficult. JOW had a large negative impact on Q. crispula dynamics in abandoned coppice forests at a regional scale, and severely damaged oak stands will become heterogeneous forests composed of various species and ages, unlike the even-aged and rather monospecific oak coppice stands.},

   abstract = {Forest biodiversity is declining due to a wide variety of anthropogenic factors. Forest and wildlife management can be part of the problem or part of the solution. Our objective was to examine the influence of white-tailed deer exclusion on the response of understory communities to a gradient in overstory disturbance. We expected that greater overstory disturbance would act synergistically with deer exclusion to increase understory species richness and abundance. In northern Wisconsin, USA, we monitored changes in understory vegetation in a temperate hardwood forest following four overstory treatments (no-harvest controls and three gap sizes) and two deer treatments (deer access or exclosure). By the seventh year following gap creation, understory species richness and the abundance of multiple species groups had increased, especially when deer were excluded. Effects were most pronounced in larger gaps, particularly among saplings of less shade-tolerant tree species. The tree seedling community responded similarly, but less strongly, to treatments. In contrast, change in the short-stature shrub and herbaceous community seven years following gap and deer treatments was limited and species-specific. Environmental conditions at the groundlayer, such as light availability and soil moisture content, rarely differed by treatment in our study. Increased density of understory vegetation at seven years post-treatment may have negated early pulses in resource availability resulting from gap creation. Gap creation alone increased species richness and abundance of woody taxa, whereas deer exclusion alone had little effect on the understory community. When treatments were applied in combination, we saw the greatest change in the plant community. Our study provides evidence that, when accompanied by a reduction in deer population density, relatively intense overstory disturbance (e.g., group-selection harvest) may be an effective management strategy for restoring forest heterogeneity.},

   abstract = {Current forestry practices in Chile largely rely on exotic tree plantations, and limited management experiences are available for the species-rich native evergreen rain forests. Yet, conservationists and forest scientists call for sustainable management of native forests as an alternative to plantations so as to maintain important ecosystem services. We parameterised the process-based forest growth model FORMIND for a Valdivian coastal temperate rain forest in Chiloé Island, Chile, to assess the ecological implications of different logging practices including selective logging and strip-cutting. We tested the model by comparing simulation results with field data from the study site and carried out an extensive sensitivity analysis to explore the impacts of parameter values on model results. Simulated logging practices were compared in regard to expected timber harvest and long-term impacts on forest structure and composition. Results showed that highest harvests could be achieved when strip-cutting was applied, because it promoted the regeneration of the relatively light-demanding and fast-growing Eucryphia cordifolia. However, forest structure and composition were severely altered by this practice. In contrast, selective logging, although providing lower harvests, better conserved old-growth forest structure and composition. Canopy gaps created by selective logging were not large enough to ensure regeneration of E. cordifolia, but favoured the shade-tolerant Laureliopsis philippiana. Overall, the similarity of logged stands to undisturbed forest decreased linearly with increasing harvesting intensity. Management strategies that rely on native species and keep an uneven-aged forest structure ensure the maintenance of native biodiversity, protect ecosystems from exotic species invasions, and promote the conservation of biotic interactions essential for tree reproduction. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Global forest restoration targets have been set, yet policy makers and land managers lack guiding principles on how to invest limited resources to achieve them. We conducted a meta-analysis of 166 studies in naturally regenerating and actively restored forests worldwide to answer: (1) To what extent do floral and faunal abundance and diversity and biogeochemical functions recover? (2) Does recovery vary as a function of past land use, time since restoration, forest region, or precipitation? (3) Does active restoration result in more complete or faster recovery than passive restoration? Overall, forests showed a high level of recovery, but the time to recovery depended on the metric type measured, past land use, and region. Abundance recovered quickly and completely, whereas diversity recovered slower in tropical than in temperate forests. Biogeochemical functions recovered more slowly after agriculture than after logging or mining. Formerly logged sites were mostly passively restored and generally recovered quickly. Mined sites were nearly always actively restored using a combination of planting and either soil amendments or recontouring topography, which resulted in rapid recovery of the metrics evaluated. Actively restoring former agricultural land, primarily by planting trees, did not result in consistently faster or more complete recovery than passively restored sites. Our results suggest that simply ending the land use is sufficient for forests to recover in many cases, but more studies are needed that directly compare the value added of active versus passive restoration strategies in the same system. Investments in active restoration should be evaluated relative to the past land use, the natural resilience of the system, and the specific objectives of each project.},

   abstract = {Is active restoration the best approach to achieve ecological restoration success (the return to a reference condition, that is, old-growth forest) when compared to natural regeneration in tropical forests? Our meta-analysis of 133 studies demonstrated that natural regeneration surpasses active restoration in achieving tropical forest restoration success for all three biodiversity groups (plants, birds, and invertebrates) and five measures of vegetation structure (cover, density, litter, biomass, and height) tested. Restoration success for biodiversity and vegetation structure was 34 to 56% and 19 to 56% higher in natural regeneration than in active restoration systems, respectively, after controlling for key biotic and abiotic factors (forest cover, precipitation, time elapsed since restoration started, and past disturbance). Biodiversity responses were based primarily on ecological metrics of abundance and species richness (74%), both of which take far less time to achieve restoration success than similarity and composition. This finding challenges the widely held notion that natural forest regeneration has limited conservation value and that active restoration should be the default ecological restoration strategy. The proposition that active restoration achieves greater restoration success than natural regeneration may have arisen because previous comparisons lacked controls for biotic and abiotic factors; we also did not find any difference between active restoration and natural regeneration outcomes for vegetation structure when we did not control for these factors. Future policy priorities should align the identified patterns of biophysical and ecological conditions where each or both restoration approaches are more successful, cost-effective, and compatible with socioeconomic incentives for tropical forest restoration.},

   abstract = {Forest gaps can change stand structure and affect forest regeneration dynamics. The gap partitioning hypothesis claims that tree species would regenerate along gap environmental gradients owing to their different resource demands. However, many studies that examined this hypothesis in uncontrolled gap conditions have yielded inconsistent conclusions and there are limited studies testing the hypothesis taking into account biomass allocation. In this study, we examined the gap partitioning hypothesis in a temperate secondary forest ecosystem where gap formation drives forest regeneration. We created gaps with different sizes and planted two commercially important native tree species with contrasting shade tolerance in nine positions along four cardinal directions within the gaps. We found that shade tolerance was the main factor affecting seedling regeneration performance within gaps. For the light-demanding Manchurian walnut (Juglans mandshurica Maxim.), seedling growth varied significantly along the light intensity gradients, which indicated that seedlings could greatly benefit from high light areas within gaps, especially when the gap size increased. Seedling biomass in gap centers and transitions (54.0 g) were much higher than in gap edges (13.7 g) and forest understories (8.6 g). High light environments contributed to higher biomass allocation to the leaves and accelerated carbon assimilation. Low light conditions resulted in increasing proportions of stem biomass, which might promote seedling height growth, although the promotion effects were relatively limited. However, for the shade-tolerant Korean spruce (Picea koraiensis Nakai), little evidence of seedling divergence was found within gaps. Mostly, seedlings only showed growth and biomass allocation differences between gaps and forest understories. Korean spruce showed high adaptability to various gap environments and might be a generalist species rather than being limited to small gaps. The performance of Manchurian walnut strongly supported the gap partitioning hypothesis, but Korean spruce provided little evidence for gap partitioning. Therefore, planting scenarios in silvicultural practices could be suitably designed, with Manchurian walnut in high light gap areas and Korean spruce in most positions within gaps, during the early stage after competition elimination.},

   abstract = {Many of the world's forests are not primeval; forest restoration aims to reverse alterations caused by human use. Forest restoration (including reforestation and forest rehabilitation) is widely researched and practiced around the globe. A review of recent literature reveals some common themes concerning forest restoration motivations and methods. In some parts of the world, forest restoration aims mainly to re-establish trees required for timber or fuelwood; such work emphasizes the propagation, establishment and growth of trees, and equates with the traditional discipline of silviculture. Elsewhere, a recent focus on biocentric values adopts the goal of supporting full complements of indigenous trees and other species. Such ecosystembased restoration approaches consider natural templates and a wide array of attributes and processes, but there remains an emphasis on trees and plant species composition. Efforts to restore natural processes such as nutrient cycling, succession, and natural disturbances seem limited, except for the use of fire, which has seen widespread adoption in some regions. The inherent challenges in restoring "naturalness" include high temporal and spatial heterogeneity in forest conditions and natural disturbances, the long history of human influence on forests in many regions of the world, and uncertainty about future climate and disturbance regimes. Although fixed templates may be inappropriate, we still have a reasonably clear idea of the incremental steps required to make forests more natural. Because most locations can support many alternative configurations of natural vegetation, the restoration of forest naturalness necessarily involves the setting of priorities and strategic directions in the context of human values and objectives, as informed by our best understanding of ecosystem structure and function now and in the future.},

   abstract = {The alarming rate of ecosystem degradation has raised the need for ecological restoration throughout different biomes and continents. North European forests may appear as one of the least vulnerable ecosystems from a global perspective, since forest cover is not rapidly decreasing and many ecosystem services remain at high level. However, extensive areas of northern forests are heavily exploited and have lost a major part of their biodiversity value. There is a strong requirement to restore these areas towards a more natural condition in order to meet the targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity. Several northern countries are now taking up this challenge by restoring forest biodiversity with increasing intensity. The ecology and biodiversity of boreal forests are relatively well understood making them a good model for restoration activities in many other forest ecosystems. Here we introduce northern forests as an ecosystem, discuss the historical and recent human impact and provide a brief status report on the ecological restoration projects and research already conducted there. Based on this discussion, we argue that before any restoration actions commence, the ecology of the target ecosystem should be established with the need for restoration carefully assessed and the outcome properly monitored. Finally, we identify the most important challenges that need to be solved in order to carry out efficient restoration with powerful and long-term positive impacts on biodiversity: coping with unpredictability, maintaining connectivity in time and space, assessment of functionality, management of conflicting interests and social restrictions and ensuring adequate funding. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {To prevent severe loss in the economic and ecological value of Central European forestland in the context of climate change and therefore seasonal water shortage, a ‘human aided migration’ with suitable species is recommended. Mediterranean oaks might cope better with Climate Change and even become increasingly competitive in Central Europe compared to other tree species. Therefore, we compared the functional and ecological strategies to endure soil drought of 9-year-old half-deciduous Quercus pubescens and evergreen Quercus ilex and their competitiveness to the local deciduous Quercus robur, using a semi-controlled setup with the possibility to control the groundwater level (large lysimeter basins filled with a loamy soil). We analyzed responses to repetitive (2014, 2015) drought stress (DS) for approximately four months, monitoring relative leaf water content (LWC), predawn water potential (ΨPD), sap flow rates, the rooting depth (by deuterium-enriched water uptake) and a proxy for biomass increase by measuring the stem diameter 5 cm above the ground (D05), and compared the results to a well-watered control treatment (CO). In 2014, significant differences between the CO and DS treatments were only visible in Q. robur. In 2015, a longer drought period in combination with extremely high temperatures in summer led to a more profound drying out of the soil under DS. Therefore, all three species showed drought responses, with ΨPD levels dropping below ‐2 MPa and LWC values dropping below 80% LWC. Sap flow rates of DS plants were also reduced compared to CO treatments. Q. robur showed the strongest response with ΨPD below −3 MPa and premature senescence. In contrast to these physiological measurements, we could not detect differences between CO and DS plants in the D05 increase and root depth for Q. ilex and Q. pubescens, only Q. robur DS displayed strong reductions in both values comparing to CO. The response for Q. robur has already been described, but the equal performance of CO and DS plants of Q. pubescens and Q. ilex contrasts previous analyses, which award evergreen oaks, like Q. ilex, a higher maximal stomatal conductance and less embolism under DS than deciduous oaks. Interestingly, both, Q. ilex and Q. pubescens, did not show a significant reduction of growth under drought (D05, rooting depth) in our lysimeter setup, despite their significant DS responses in LWC, sap flow and ΨPD.},

   abstract = {1. The spatial population structure of parasites may have profound effects on both ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Strong gene flow among local populations has been hypothesized to prevent differential performance on local and foreign hosts. 2. We studied the spatial population structure of an obligate pathogen, the oak mildew (Microsphaera alphitoides) on the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). Patterns of distribution and colonization-extinction dynamics were recorded in a set of 113 trees over 3 years, and in an additional set of 77 trees over 2 years. Colonization of uninfected hosts was examined in a set of 100 experimentally transplanted hosts, and differential performance on local and foreign hosts tested by reciprocal inoculations conducted in the laboratory. 3. Across years, the mildew occupied a high proportion of host trees (≥ 2/3). Patterns of mildew infection showed either no spatial aggregation (years 2003, 2005), or aggregation at a large spatial scale (up to 400 m; year 2004). High and even incidence of infection reflects efficient dispersal: during a single year, transplanted uninfected host plants were rapidly colonized in all parts of the landscape. 4. Local mildew populations still performed best on their original hosts: in reciprocal inoculations conducted on mature foliage, local mildew populations infected a significantly higher proportion of leaves from their original host tree than from other trees. Yet, even on the local host less than half of the leaves were infected. 5. To account for the observed patterns, two selection processes are invoked. The colonization experiment suggests that mildew spores are spread widely, with selection filtering out the genotypes that cannot infect the focal host. Local mildew populations are subject to further selection events later in the summer, favouring the strains best adapted to phenological changes in the local environment. 6. In conclusion, the patterns observed and processes inferred in M. alphitoides suggest that complex selection pressures may affect local parasite populations, blurring any clear-cut relation between gene flow and performance on local and foreign hosts. © 2007 The Authors.},

   abstract = {Forest development is a complex phenomenon which, for the number of actors involved and the response time expressed by forests, is difficult to understand and explore. Forests in Italy, as in several areas of Europe, are experiencing intensive management and recently, an increasing impact by ungulates. The effects on forest development of these two disturbances combined are difficult to predict, and consequently to be properly managed. We used a forest landscape change model, LANDIS-II, to simulate forest development as driven by forestry practices and roe deer impact for 200 years in a mountain forest of the Italian Apennines. We found that each disturbance alters forest tree species richness, forest type abundance and distribution, and forest structure. When considered combined, the two disturbances show additive behavior, enhancing or moderating each other’s effects. Forest management has a negative effect on tree species richness. We expected roe deer to have a negative effect on harvest yields, but this result was significant only for two of seven harvesting treatments. On the other hand, roe deer presence had a positive effect on tree species richness. All the simulation scenarios returned some extent of forest loss. The amount of the forest loss is lowest in the scenario without disturbances, and greatest when both disturbances are considered. However, the two disturbances combined, with the magnitude modelled in our simulations, have relatively low effects on the forest dynamics we analyzed in our study area. LANDIS-II was an effective approach for simulating combined management and ungulate driven trends of forest development, and to help understand the dynamics that lay behind it.},

   abstract = {The successful development of early stages of blight-resistant hybrid stock has increased hopes for restoration of American chestnut (Castanea dentata) to eastern North American forests. However, these forests have undergone substantial ecological change in the century since the functional extirpation of American chestnut, and it remains unknown to what extent American chestnut will be able to recolonize contemporary forests. In particular, high densities of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and competition with mesophytic tree species such as maple (Acer) may impede chestnut regeneration, much as they affect oak (Quercus). We used a split-plot analysis of variance (ANOVA) design to examine the effects of canopy gaps and herbivory on survival and growth of third generation backcrossed (BC<inf>3</inf>) hybrid chestnut seedlings over two growing seasons in central Indiana, U.S.A. Only 4 of 588 (0.7%) seedlings in closed-canopy plots survived to the end of the study, as opposed to 264 of 589 (45%) seedlings in gap plots. Within the gap treatment, fencing was associated with reduced chestnut survival as well as reduced herbivory and increased cover of non-chestnut vegetation. Our results indicate that herbivory may indirectly benefit chestnut regeneration by suppressing competition. However, this beneficial effect is likely context-dependent and additional work is needed to establish the conditions under which it occurs.},

   abstract = {Positive feedbacks in drivers of degradation can cause threshold responses in natural ecosystems. Though threshold responses have received much attention in studies of aquatic ecosystems, they have been neglected in terrestrial systems, such as forests, where the long time-scales required for monitoring have impeded research. In this study we explored the role of positive feedbacks in a temperate forest that has been monitored for 50 years and is undergoing dieback, largely as a result of death of the canopy dominant species (Fagus sylvatica, beech). Statistical analyses showed strong non-linear losses in basal area for some plots, while others showed relatively gradual change. Beech seedling density was positively related to canopy openness, but a similar relationship was not observed for saplings, suggesting a feedback whereby mortality in areas with high canopy openness was elevated. We combined this observation with empirical data on size- and growth-mediated mortality of trees to produce an individual-based model of forest dynamics. We used this model to simulate changes in the structure of the forest over 100 years under scenarios with different juvenile and mature mortality probabilities, as well as a positive feedback between seedling and mature tree mortality. This model produced declines in forest basal area when critical juvenile and mature mortality probabilities were exceeded. Feedbacks in juvenile mortality caused a greater reduction in basal area relative to scenarios with no feedback. Non-linear, concave declines of basal area occurred only when mature tree mortality was 3–5 times higher than rates observed in the field. Our results indicate that the longevity of trees may help to buffer forests against environmental change and that the maintenance of old, large trees may aid the resilience of forest stands. In addition, our work suggests that dieback of forests may be avoidable providing pressures on mature and juvenile trees do not pass critical thresholds.},

We examined tree seedling emergence and growth of 10 major species over 10 years at four plots: inside and outside a deer exclosure under a gap and under a closed canopy (the plots were named “GAPF”, “GAP”, “CCF” and “CC”, respectively). Seedlings of Abies firma, Acer palmatum and Zelkova serrata were noted at all four plots during the initial investigation. Seedlings of five pioneer species emerged in GAPF and GAP, but had showed almost no emergence in CC and CCF. Seedlings of 10 target species showed the greatest tendency toward survival at GAPF among the plots. The survival of six species’ seedlings was significantly higher (p < 0.0487) at GAPF than at CCF. The height of most seedlings was <20 cm at first measurement. After 10 years, the maximum heights of 10 species showed that all species grew taller at GAPF but scarcely grew at the other plots. The height distribution at GAPF showed that pioneer species dominated >150 cm, while A. firma, A. palmatum and Z. serrata were mainly <120 cm. These results suggest that the 10 species were able to survive and grow most successfully in the gap without sika deer and that the construction of a deer exclosure just after gap formation was effective in promoting the regeneration of the overbrowsed forest.},

We examined these linkages in forest ground-layer plant communities using a replicated, manipulative field experiment. Treatments included a range of gap sizes and untreated controls. We assessed spatial and temporal responses over the first three years following gap creation. 3. Light transmittance and soil water content increased with gap size, while rates of colonization and species richness increased after a critical threshold. Subsequent increases in productivity were associated with declines in species richness, increased rates of local extirpation and a unimodal relationship between species richness and productivity at the individual quadrat scale (4 m2). 4. The richness and productivity of vines, shrubs and especially graminoids, increased within 200-380 m2 gaps treatments. However, the productivity of forbs and tree seedlings did not, showing possible drought sensitivity overriding treatments. Spatial and temporal partitioning of gaps occurred as a result of interactions between species traits and environmental conditions. Significantly, productivity and richness showed complex relationships with canopy structure. 5. Synthesis. Our results show that richness increases to an asymptote after a critical threshold in disturbance severity initially. Decreases in species richness over time associated with increases in productivity may eventually result in the unimodal relationship predicted by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. However, species composition continues to differ with canopy gap size, suggesting a range of canopy gap sizes is required to maintain the greatest diversity of plant species over broader spatial and temporal scales.},

Nature is usually assumed to respond to gradual change in a smooth way. However, studies on lakes, coral reefs, oceans, forests and arid lands have shown that smooth change can be interrupted by sudden drastic switches to a contrasting state. Although diverse events can trigger such shifts, recent studies show that a loss of resilience usually paves the way for a switch to an alternative state.

   abstract = {The food resources of forest ungulates typically are patchily distributed. Research on foraging behaviour has often focused on habitat selection but has rarely taken into account the influence of the spatial distribution of different food patches in two dimensions. However, especially when travelling costs become significant, the pattern of resource distribution is likely to be a major factor in determining foraging behaviour and, hence, ungulate distribution. Using a modelling approach I examine the effects of group size and the effects of increasing inter-patch distance for various resource distribution patterns (random, uniform and aggregated) on the spatial distribution of foraging time for an ungulate in an hypothetical environment. The animal is faced with two patch types: food and non-food. Food patches are loaded with a similar initial forage quantity and productivity. They may be depleted but regenerate by a constant production rate. Forage quality is assumed to decline with increasing standing crop. Young regrowth therefore has the potential to attract ungulates by virtue of its high quality. The foraging ungulate, represented by a large-bodied ruminant, is assumed to follow an energy maximising strategy. It decides at regular intervals to stay or to leave for another patch by balancing potential energy intake and travel costs. The results of the simulations reveal that travel costs can be an important factor in foraging decisions, even though they constitute less than 10% of the daily energy intake. The total number of exploited patches over a 100-day period was mainly determined by forage depletion rate. The number of patches visited daily was a function of both inter-patch distance and forage depletion rate. By differences in the variation of inter-patch distance, the distribution mode has important implications for the foraging route and the number of daily patch visits. With respect to grazing management the important implication is that, aside from the relevance of forage quality and abundance, the spatial distribution of food resources is another factor determining concentrations of ungulates and, hence, their impact on the vegetation. Determination of the appropriate time scale of foraging decisions needs further study, as the role of travel costs increases with a shorter time horizon and leads to a higher ungulate aggregation.},

Here, we tested this with seedlings of 24 neotropical tree species differing in shade tolerance and leaf lifespan under standardized field conditions (140-867d in gaps; longer in shade). We quantified toughness with a cutting test, explicitly seeking a mechanistic linkage to fibre. Lamina density, but not fracture toughness, exhibited a plastic response to gaps vs shade, while neither trait was affected by leaf age. Toughness corrected for lamina density, a recently recognized indicator of material strength per unit mass, was linearly correlated with cellulose content per unit dry mass. Leaf lifespan was positively correlated with cellulose and toughness in shade-tolerant species but only weakly in gap-dependent species. Leaf lifespan was uncorrelated with lamina thickness, phenolics and tannin concentrations. In path analysis including all species, leaf lifespan was directly enhanced by density and toughness, and indirectly by cellulose via its effect on toughness. Different suites of leaf traits were correlated with early seedling survival in gaps vs shade. In conclusion, cellulose and lamina density jointly enhance leaf fracture toughness, and these carbon-based physical traits, rather than phenolic-based defence, explain species differences in herbivory, leaf lifespan and shade survival. © 2012 The Authors.

Typical measures to ensure forest regeneration have included physical barriers or direct manipulation of deer densities. However, altering silvicultural practices to provide abundant deer forage has not been tested thoroughly. We examined browse species preferences and changes in herbivory rates in 1-6 year old regeneration areas from 2001 to 2004 in the central Appalachians on the MeadWestvaco Wildlife and Ecosystem Research Forest in West Virginia. Woody vegetation reached the maximum plot coverage by the 4th growing season. However, the establishment of less abundant woody species, such as northern red oak (Quercus rubra), may be inhibited when browsed greater than or proportionally to occurrence. Herbivory rates declined precipitously as the amount of early successional habitat increased on our study site. We conclude that providing approximately 14% of an area in well-distributed, even-aged managed forests can have substantial impacts on reducing herbivory rates. However, management practices also should consider harvesting effects on hard mast production, habitat requirements of other species, and hardwood lumber marketability. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Browsing lawns, as an analogue of the influential grazing lawn concept, received increased recent interest. We revisit this concept and ask whether the underlying characteristics of a grazing lawn can indeed be generalized to browser-woody plant interactions. Based on previous studies, we define a lawn as a grazed or browsed patch in which intense foraging leads to increased resource availability and a proportional increase of palatable plant species in the patch. We then argue that present examples do not fully support a browsing lawn analogue. Although intense browsing can lead to increased resource availability, it generally reduces the share of palatable plant species in the community. We present an example that does seem to fit both lawn conditions; intensely browsed regeneration patches of palatable trees in Białowieża Primeval forest. Browsing not only prunes these regeneration patches into lawn-like structures, but also increases the share of palatable species in the tree community. Finally, we outline key open issues of the browsing lawn analogue and discuss the discrepancy between our example and the general understanding that browsing reduces the share of palatable tree species. We suggest that lawns are most likely to develop in relatively resource-rich environments where plants can invest in tolerance traits and in situations where herbivores show strong patch selection but are relatively unselective for individual plants within the patch. Although our example fits these conditions, many studies on browser-woody plant interactions come from relatively nutrient poor systems with strong selection for individual palatable trees. More studies in systems similar to our example might show that positive interactions between browsing and the proportion of palatable woody species in a community are not so rare. © 2011 Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics.},

   abstract = {Interspecific differences in shade tolerance among woody species are considered a primary driving force underlying forest succession. However, variation in shade tolerance may be only one of many interspecific differences that cause species turnover. For example, tree species may differ in their sensitivity to herbivory. Nonetheless, existing conceptual models of forest dynamics rarely explicitly consider the impact of herbivores. We examined whether browsing by whitetailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmermann) alters the relationship between light availability and plant performance. We monitored growth and survival for seedlings of six woody species over 2 years within six windthrow gaps and the nearby intact forest in the presence and absence of deer. Browsing decreased seedling growth for all species except beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.). More importantly, browsing altered growth rankings among species. Increased light availability enhanced growth for three species when excluded from deer, but browsing obscured these relationships. Browsing also reduced survival for three species; however, survival rankings did not significantly differ between herbivory treatments. Our results indicated that browsing and light availability operated simultaneously to influence plant growth within these forests. Thus, existing models of forest dynamics may make inaccurate predictions of the timing and composition of species reaching the canopy, unless they can account for how plant performance varies as a result of a variety of environmental factors, including herbivory.},

   abstract = {Understanding the degree of spatial fidelity exhibited by individuals within a species increases our ability to manage for desired future outcomes. Elk (Cervus elaphus) is a closely managed species in the Western US, but there is little research evaluating their summer home-range fidelity. Elk summer-fall home-ranges overlap considerably with aspen (Populus tremuloides)-dominated forest types, and elk can impact aspen regeneration because it is a preferred browse species. We evaluated the fidelity of 72 adult female elk to individual summer-fall home ranges in northwestern Colorado, USA, during two consecutive summers (1996 and 1997). To compare elk summer-fall home-range overlap and distribution based on individual kernel-estimated utilization distributions, we calculated the volume-of-intersection statistic and the inter-annual distances between centers-of-mass. We found adult female elk in the White River Study area exhibited strong fidelity to individual home ranges. Volume-of-intersection results indicated that 93% of the elk showed explicit home-range overlap between 1996 and 1997, but that all the elk returned to the same vicinity as the previous year (median = 0.42, SE = 0.02, n = 72). Between-year center-of-mass distances ranged from 183 m to 34,170 m (mean = 3819, SE = 619, n = 72), while within-year maximum distances between location points ranged from 4320 m to 31,680 m (mean = 13,958, SE = 628, n = 72). Hunting increased the distance traveled by individual elk, but did not change the center of their home-range. Understanding female elk home-range fidelity could influence forest management focused on aspen regeneration. Specifically, targeted removal of female elk from their summer-fall home ranges could create a ‘window of opportunity’ in which browsing pressure was reduced, and the likelihood of aspen recruitment increased.},

Although it has been described to efficiently compete for water and nutrients, little is known on its competitive ability for light. We described bramble canopy architecture, cover relative to light availability and light interception ability in 60 areas of bramble thicket at 17 sites in France and 1 in England with contrasting soils and climates. The leaf area and leaf number can be predicted by the cane (shoot) length. The leaf inclination distribution was planophile (i.e. leaf laminas distributed in the horizontal plane). There was a good relationship between light interception and leaf area index (LAI) of the different bramble thickets, with no significant site influence, meaning that a single model can be used to predict light interception by bramble in different conditions. Bramble LAI and cover rapidly increased with light availability in the understorey to reach almost 20% cover at only 5-7% light availability above the thicket. Consequently, bramble is able to tolerate deep shade, which is not in accordance with its reputed moderate to high light requirement reported in the literature and suggests that it is difficult to control this species by manipulating tree canopy. This would have adverse consequences on tree regeneration. © 2012 Institute of Chartered Foresters. All rights reserved.},

Woody biomass production (Bw) in the first year was analysed as the product of the proportion of dry matter partitioned to wood (η-), the seasonal mean efficiency with which intercepted light was used to produce dry matter (e\{open\}-), the mean fraction of incident light intercepted by the canopies (f-), and the amount of incoming solar radiation over the season (A). Thus, Bw = η-f-e\{open\}-A.For Salix, Bw=10 t ha-1y-1, while for Populus, Bw = 5 t ha-1y-1, mainly because of differences in η- and f-. The Populus partitioned more dry matter to roots (and correspondingly less to stems) and intercepted less light over the growing season. The Salix and Populus clones had surprisingly similar (e\{open\}-) values, namely 1. 58 and 1. 50 g MJ-1, respectively (based on total dry matter and total solar radiation), which are very like the e\{open\}- values measured on C3 agricultural crops in Britain.

The combined manipulations of secondary consumers, primary consumers, and plant resources allowed us to examine some of the direct and indirect effects on each trophic level and to determine the relative contributions of bottom-up and top-down cascades to the structure of the community. We found that enhanced plant resources (nutrients and light) had direct positive effects on plant biomass. However, we found no evidence of indirect (cascading through the herbivores) effects of plant biomass on predators or top predators. In contrast, ants had indirect effects on plant biomass by decreasing herbivory on the plants.

Most studies on top-down vs. bottom-up control of plant biomass focus on nutrients as basal resources, whereas light has received considerably less attention. 2 Effects of light and nutrients may differ because light represents a vertical resource and plant adaptations to acquire light might counteract or facilitate consumer effects. I tested the interaction between light supply and consumer presence in a meta-analysis of experiments that manipulated both these factors factorially and measured the biomass of benthic algae (periphyton). 3 Both grazer removal and light enhancement had positive effects on algal biomass. These two factors showed strong interactions, which exceeded previously observed interaction terms between nutrient supply and grazer removal. Positive light effects on algal biomass were primarily observed in the absence of grazers. Grazer effects became stronger at high light supply, which indicated that high light favours algal growth types that are easily ingested. 4 Further analyses showed that light effects increased with trophic state of the habitat and with algal biomass, indicating enhanced importance of light limitation and self-shading at high nutrient supply. Grazer effects depended on grazer biomass and varied with type of experimental manipulation. 5 This study implies that light is of similar importance as nutrients in resource control of benthic algal biomass. High light levels simultaneously enhance consumer control of algal biomass, resulting in strong resource vs. consumer interactions. Light competition and consumer presence pose a trade-off on algal growth, where growth form may distinguish between adaptations to acquire light and to avoid consumption. © 2005 British Ecological Society.},

   abstract = {How top-down and bottom-up processes interact in terrestrial systems is an important ecological question, yet well designed studies addressing this question are rare. We tested the interaction of these two processes in an old-field community by simultaneously manipulating nutrient level and large cursorial spider density in a replicated field experiment. Spider density and nutrient level interacted to determine overall growth of plants, with the greatest plant biomass occurring in plots with normal predator density and elevated nutrients. Plant growth was increased for a short period of time in all plots with elevated nutrient levels. However, with predator abundance reduced, Homoptera were able to increase in nutrient addition plots and cause a subsequent reduction in plant growth. Other herbivorous arthropods appeared unaffected by our experimental treatments. Spider reduction also significantly reduced plant diversity while nutrient effects on plant diversity were nonsignificant. Manipulation of predators and nutrients affected the biomass and behavior of smaller cursorial spiders. Biomass of these smaller predators increased with top spider reduction, which in turn enhanced emigration of these smaller spiders. This study demonstrates that top-down and bottom-up processes can interact to affect the biomass of several different trophic levels and the behavior of organisms within those trophic levels. However, only some components of this diverse community were significantly affected by our manipulations, indicating that strong trophic interactions can exist within a framework of weaker interactions in a diverse system. Researchers of trophic interactions need to recognize that top-down and bottom-up processes are not acting in isolation. Therefore, results of studies investigating top-down or bottom-up processes alone must be interpreted cautiously, and ideally these processes should not be studied independently.},

Situated at the mouth of the Columbia River, OR, East Sand Island (ESI) is home to the largest Caspian tern breeding colony in North America. Since 2001, the decline in fledging success of Caspian terns at ESI has been associated with a significant increase in average river discharge during May and June. During the years 2001–2011, the abundance of forage fish available to terns in the estuary was inversely related to river discharge. This relationship also apparently affected the reliance of nest predators on the tern colony as a food source, resulting in increased disturbance and decreased fledging success at the tern colony in years of higher river discharge. There was a significant longitudinal increase in disturbance rates by bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) during June for terns nesting at the ESI colony, and eagle disturbance rates were positively associated with May river discharge. We also found a significant increase in kleptoparasitism rates of terns by hybrid glaucous-winged/western gulls (Larus glaucescens x Larus occidentalis) since 2001, and Caspian tern fledging success at ESI decreased with increasing average annual rates of gull kleptoparasitism. Our results support the hypothesis that the decline in Caspian tern fledging success at this large estuarine colony was primarily driven by the interaction of bottom-up and top-down factors, influencing tern fledging success through the food supply and triggering potential predators to identify the tern breeding colony as an alternative source of prey.},

However, the resulting pattern of trophic control in complex food webs is an emergent property of the system and thus unintuitive. We develop a statistical nondeterministic model, capable of modeling complex patterns of trophic control for the heavily impacted North Sea ecosystem. The model is driven solely by fishing mortality and climatic variables and based on time-series data covering >40 y for six plankton and eight fish groups along with one bird group (>20 y). Simulations show the outstanding importance of top-down exploitation pressure for the dynamics of fish populations. Whereas fishing effects on predators indirectly altered plankton abundance, bottom-up climatic processes dominate plankton dynamics. Importantly, we show planktivorous fish to have a central role in the North Sea food web initiating complex cascading effects across and between trophic levels. Our linked model integrates bottom-up and top-down effects and is able to simulate complex long-term changes in ecosystem components under a combination of stressor scenarios. Our results suggest that in marine ecosystems, pathways for bottom-up and top-down forces are not necessarily mutually exclusive and together can lead to the emergence of complex patterns of control.},

Therefore, we have little idea about their generality, scales of variability, or reliance on local conditions. Transplant experiments and surveys conducted at 14 sites spanning across ∼900 km of the central Chilean coast demonstrate that alongshore variation in upwelling, occurring over 10s to 100s of kilometers, explains among-site differences in growth rates of the turf-forming alga Gelidium chilense, which drives predictable landscape patterns in turf height. At upwelling centers, turf algae grew faster and attained taller heights than at warmer downstream locations, where the algal turf remained short because it grew slower and was pruned-back in winter. Replicated, reciprocal transplants of tall and short algal turf, combined with manipulations that controlled predator access to turf, revealed that recruitment of the mussel Perumytilus purpuratus was differentially enhanced by the turf; benefits were strong when the turf was short, but disappeared when the turf was tall. By determining mussel prey supply to higher trophic levels, upwelling-controlled facilitation has important consequences for community regulation.

Wild nettles of Nara Park exhibited smaller leaf area, 11-223 times more stinging hairs per leaf, and 58-630-times higher stinging hair densities than those of other areas where there was no evidence of sika deer browsing. There were no significant differences in stinging hair length between the areas. Nettles from Nara Park that were cultivated from seeds in a greenhouse retained a larger number and higher density of stinging hairs. In the field, nettles of Nara Park were less frequently browsed by sika deer and showed higher survivorship than nettles that were transplanted from an unbrowsed area into Nara Park. These results indicate that: (1) the U. thunbergiana population of Nara Park has an extremely high stinging hair density compared with those of unbrowsed areas; (2) this characteristic has a genetic basis, and (3) stinging hairs serve as a defensive structure against sika deer, contributing to an increase in survivorship. Thus, we conclude that a U. thunbergiana population in Nara Park, with extremely high stinging hair densities, has evolved through natural selection due to heavy browsing by sika deer. © 2007 The Ecological Society of Japan.},

   abstract = {Summary: Browsing by overabundant white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) has altered ecological relationships in forest communities across eastern North America. Recent but limited work suggests that deer browsing also selects for particular plant defensive traits. We hypothesized that browsing by deer has imposed selection on defensive traits in an annual native wildflower, orange jewelweed (Impatiens capensis). To test this hypothesis, we collected individuals from 26 natural populations across a 5000 km2 area in New York State, USA. Half of these populations were historically protected from deer and half were exposed to heavy browsing. We planted individuals in common gardens subjected to natural deer browsing or no browsing. Individuals from historically browsed populations exhibited significantly higher tolerance than those from historically protected populations. Herbivory by deer reduced lifetime fruit production by only 20% in historically browsed populations, as opposed to 57% in historically protected populations. Two mechanisms were correlated with this increased tolerance: increased number of flowering days and increased fruits per flowering node. Synthesis. The increased tolerance of historically browsed populations suggests that these populations evolved increased tolerance or that historically protected populations lost tolerance over time. Variation in tolerance traits in native plant species may allow them to persist in the face of rapid ecological change. A common garden experiment demonstrates that individual orange jewelweed (Impatiens capensis) from populations historically browsed by deer in New York State are more able to tolerate contemporary browse than those from historically protected populations. This suggests the rapid evolution of tolerance to deer browse. Variation in tolerance traits in native plant species may allow them to persist in the face of rapid ecological change.

   abstract = {Deer (Cervidae) cause considerable damage to forest plantations, crops, and protected habitats. The most common response to this damage is to implement strategies to lower population densities. However, lowering deer density may not always be desirable from hunting, recreational, or conservation perspectives. Therefore, knowledge is needed about additional factors beyond deer density that affect damage levels, and management actions that consider competing management goals. We studied the relationships between levels of bark-stripping by red deer (Cervus elaphus) on Norway spruce (Picea abies) and (1) relative deer density indices (pellet group count and deer harvest data), (2) availability of alternative natural forage (cover of forage species) and (3) proportion forest in the landscape, both at a forest stand scale and at a landscape scale. Extensive variation in damage level was evident between the six study areas. On a stand scale, the proportion of spruce damaged was positively related to pellet group density, indicating the importance of local deer usage of stands. In addition, available alternative forage in the field layer within spruce stands and proportion forest surrounding stands was negatively related to damage level. On the landscape scale, damage level was negatively related to availability of forage in the field and shrub layers and proportion forest, but was not related to any of the relative deer density indices. Increasing alternative forage may thus decrease damage and thereby reduce conflicts. Additionally, the proportion of forest in the landscape affects damage levels and should thus be considered in landscape planning and when forecasting damage risk. The relationship between local deer usage of stands and damage level suggests that future studies should try to separate the effects of local deer usage and deer density. © 2014 Jarnemo et al.},

In commercial forestry, a threshold of 4 deer per 100ha has been suggested. Unfenced native woodlands seem to regenerate naturally if there are fewer than 4-5 large deer or fewer than 25 roe deer Capreolus capreolus per 100ha; open habitats may suffer only light or moderate impacts from red deer Cervus elaphus at landscape densities of 7-8 per 100ha. Woodland bird species may have declined where deer densities are high but absolute thresholds seem impossible to establish. One study suggests maximum diversity at about 8 white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus per 100ha. Deer-vehicle collisions are affected by various factors in addition to deer density, but British and American studies suggest that accident frequencies decline at densities below 7-8 per 100ha. Fallow deer Dama dama populations may maintain bovine TB (bTB) infection at much lower densities (25/100ha) than red or roe deer (91/100ha and 200/100ha, respectively) assuming 100% prevalence. Even at 30% prevalence a density of 75 fallow deer per 100ha could maintain bTB within the population. We conclude that deer density alone is unlikely to be a good predictor of impact, and suggest that long-term management should be based on assessment both of actual impacts and apparent density of deer. © 2011 The Authors.

   abstract = {1 This review brings into focus what is known about the response of the herbaceous layer of forest ecosystems to increasing nitrogen deposition. The emphasis on forests in general is important for two reasons. First, forests often occupy areas receiving high rates of atmospheric deposition of N. Second, compared with herb-dominated communities, about which much is known regarding response to excess N, forests generally display greater biological and structural complexity. The more specific focus on the herbaceous layer - here defined as all vascular (herbaceous and woody) plants ≤ 1 m in height - is warranted because most of the species diversity of forests occurs in the herb layer. 2 Most responses of forest ecosystems to N saturation, defined here as ecosystem supply of N exceeding ecosystem demand for N, can be characterized by two complementary hypotheses, each emphasizing different facets of ecosystem structure and function. One focuses on ecosystem processes, such as net primary productivity, whereas the other addresses seasonal patterns of concentrations of NO3- in stream water. Although neither hypothesis considers the effects of chronically elevated N deposition on forest herbs, both share a prediction - a dramatic increase in availability of NO3- - that is relevant to forest herb response. Such a shift towards NO3- dominance has important implications for changes in herbaceous layer dynamics. For example, increases in soil NO3- pools can increase invasibility by exotic species. Also, because preferential use of NH4+ vs. NO3- can be highly species-specific among forest herbs, predominance of NO 3- availability can bring about further changes in herb layer species composition. Also important to forest herbs is the tendency for enhanced mobility of NO3- to increase mobility and decrease availability of essential cations, such as Ca2+. 3 The response of plant species of the herbaceous layer of forest ecosystems to excess N availability can arise from N-mediated changes in several processes. Here I identify six - competition, herbivory, mycorrhizal infection, disease, species invasions and exotic earthworm activity - and discuss how they respond to excess N and how this response affects the herb layer of forests. With the exception of the activity of exotic earthworms (which is correlated with, but not necessarily caused by, high N deposition), there is compelling evidence that all processes respond sensitively to N deposition and that this response generally leads to drastic shifts in species composition and decreases in biodiversity of forest herb communities. 4 A hypothesis is suggested - the nitrogen homogeneity hypothesis - that predicts loss of biodiversity in forest ecosystems experiencing chronically elevated N deposition. This hypothesis is based on the decrease in spatial heterogeneity of N availability that is typically high in forest soils under N-limited conditions. © 2006 The Author.},

   abstract = {We tested the interactions between biotic and abiotic factors in structuring temperate forest communities by comparing tree recruitment after 7 years inside 30 pairs of exclosure (excluding ungulates: red deer, roe deer, bison, moose, wild boar) and control plots (7 × 7 m each) in one of the most natural forest systems in Europe, the Białowieża Primeval Forest (eastern Poland). The strictly protected part of that forest hosts the complete native variety in trees, ungulates and their carnivores and excludes human intervention.2. We analysed whether the exclosure effect interacted with abiotic factors, relevant for tree recruitment (canopy cover, ground vegetation cover, soil fertility and soil wetness) at different stages of tree regeneration (seedlings, saplings ≤ 50 and > 50 cm).3. Contrary to our expectations, a single factor dominated at each stage of tree regeneration. Herbaceous vegetation cover was the main factor determining the number of seedlings with an optimum at 38% of cover. Soil fertility determined the density of saplings ≤ 50 cm, with on average three times higher density on eutrophic than on oligotrophic soils. Herbivory was the main factor determining recruitment rate of trees into > 50 cm size classes only.4. The density of saplings that grew into the > 50 cm size class was more than three times higher in the exclosures than in the control plots during 7 years. In the absence of ungulates, on average 3.1 species recruited into the > 50 cm size class compared to 1.7 in control plots. Tree species occurred in more equal proportions inside exclosures, whereas species composition was pushed towards strong dominance of a preferred forage species, Carpinus betulus, in the presence of ungulates. This suggests that preference of species by ungulates can coincide with tolerance to browsing.5. Synthesis. The study showed that abiotic conditions dominated the early stages and ungulate impact the later stages of tree regeneration, indicating the context-dependence of herbivore top-down effects. Heterogeneity in abiotic and biotic conditions may, therefore, have an important influence on the strength of top-down effects and the role that herbivores play in natural ecosystems. © 2010 The Authors.

Using conceptual advances from savanna ecology, particularly the demographic bottleneck model, we present a novel view on temperate forest dynamics that integrates consumer and resource control. We used a fully factorial experiment, with varying levels of ungulate herbivory and resource (light) availability, to investigate how these factors shape recruitment of five temperate tree species. We ran simulations to project how inter- and intraspecific differences in height increment under the different experimental scenarios influence long-term recruitment of tree species. Strong herbivore-driven demographic bottlenecks occurred in our temperate forest system, and bottlenecks were as strong under resource-rich as under resource-poor conditions. Increased browsing by herbivores in resource-rich patches strongly counteracted the increased escape strength of saplings in these patches. This finding is a crucial extension of the demographic bottleneck model which assumes that increased resource availability allows plants to more easily escape consumer-driven bottlenecks. Our study demonstrates that a more dynamic understanding of consumer–resource interactions is necessary, where consumers and plants both respond to resource availability.},

   abstract = {The effects of moose rebrowsing on damage development in young Scots pine stands, ages 6-18 years, were examined using data from a large-scale survey in northern Sweden. Recent stem damage from moose browsing (browsing of the apical leader, breaking of the main stem, or stripping bark off the main stem) from the winter immediately preceding the survey was noted in 10% of the Scots pine main stems. The corresponding figure for previous stem damage was 17%. In total, 36% of all recorded recent stem damage occurred in previously damaged Scots pine stems, about twice as much as expected from random tree browsing. At low levels of previous stem damage the observed rebrowsing was about four times higher than that would be expected from random tree browsing. When more than 50% of all Scots pine main stems displayed previous stem damage, the observed rebrowsing rate was approximately the same as would be expected from random tree browsing. The observed rebrowsing and the rebrowsing expected from random tree browsing increased with increasing stand age. However, the rebrowsing expected from random tree browsing was considerably lower than the observed rebrowsing at all stand ages studied. Rebrowsing affects the calculation of undamaged Scots pine main stems after moose browsing. At 2% annual damage, the number of undamaged pine trees in a stand aged 18 years increased by 10% when rebrowsing was considered. At 10% annual damage no undamaged trees remained when rebrowsing was disregarded, but around 400 trees ha-1 remained when rebrowsing was taken into consideration. Taking rebrowsing into consideration makes it possible to make more accurate calculations of the final effects of moose browsing on future stands. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Resource regulation occurs when herbivory maintains or increases plant susceptibility to further herbivory by the same species. A review of the literature indicates it is a widespread plant-animal interaction involving a diverse array of herbivores. At least three mechanisms can produce this positive feedback cycle. First, phytophagous insect and mammalian herbivore damage can stimulate dormant buds to produce vigorous juvenile growth, which is preferred for further attack. Juvenilization cycles may have repeatedly evolved because herbivores are able to take advantage of a generalized plant compensatory response to any type of damage. Second, herbivores can manipulate plant source-sink relationships to attain more resources, and this alteration of plant growth may benefit subsequent herbivore generations. Third, herbivory can alter plant nutrition or defensive chemistry in a way that makes a plant susceptible to more herbivory. Resource regulation probably occurs because damage to resources preferred by the herbivores induces a generalized plant response that produces more preferred resources. Alternatively, manipulation of plant resources to induce resource regulation may have evolved in herbivores with a high degree of philopatry due to selection to alter plant resources to benefit their offspring. Resource regulation can stabilize insect population dynamics by maintaining a supply of high-quality plant resources. It can also increase the heterogeneity of host-plant resources for herbivores by altering the physiological age structure and the distribution of resources within plants. Resource regulation may have strong plant-mediated effects on other organisms that use that host plant, but these effects have not yet been explored. © 2010 The Society of Population Ecology and Springer.},

   abstract = {We studied the effects of grazing by Black Brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) geese (hereafter Brant) on plant community zonation and gosling growth between 1987 and 2000 at a nesting colony in southwestern Alaska. The preferred forage of Brant, Carex subspathacea, is only found as a grazing lawn. An alternate forage species, C. ramenskii, exists primarily as meadow but also forms grazing lawns when heavily grazed. We mowed plots of ungrazed C. ramenskii meadows to create swards that Brant could select and maintain as grazing lawns. Fecal counts were higher on mowed plots than on control plots in the year after plots were mowed. Both nutritional quality and aboveground biomass of C. ramenskii in mowed plots were similar to that of C. subspathacea grazing lawns. The areal extent of grazing lawns depends in part on the population size of Brant. High Brant populations can increase the areal extent of grazing lawns, which favors the growth of goslings. Grazing lawns increased from 3% to 8% of surface area as the areal extent of C. ramenskii meadows declined between 1991 and 1999. Gosling mass was lower early in this time period due to density dependent effects. As the goose population stabilized, and area of grazing lawns increased, gosling mass increased between 1993 and 1999. Because larger goslings have increased survival, higher probability of breeding, and higher fecundity, herbivore-mediated changes in the distribution grazing lawn extent may result in a numerical increase of the population within the next two decades.},

   abstract = {Grazing lawns are a distinct grassland community type, characterised by short-stature and with their persistence and spread promoted by grazing. In Africa, they reveal a long co-evolutionary history of grasses and large mammal grazers. The attractiveness to grazers of a low-biomass sward lies in the relatively high quality of forage, largely due to the low proportion of stem material in the sward; this encourages repeat grazing that concomitantly suppresses tall-grass growth forms that would otherwise outcompete lawn species for light. Regular grazing that prevents shading and maintains sward quality is thus the cornerstone of grazing lawn dynamics. The strong interplay between abiotic conditions and disturbance factors, which are central to grazing lawn existence, can also cause these systems to be highly dynamic. Here we identify differences in growth form among grazing lawn grass species, and assess how compositional differences among lawn types, as well as environmental variables, influence their maintenance requirements (i.e. grazing frequency) and vulnerability to degradation. We also make a clear distinction between the processes of lawn establishment and lawn maintenance. Rainfall, soil nutrient status, grazer community composition and fire regime have strong and interactive influences on both processes. However, factors that concentrate grazing pressure (e.g. nutrient hotspots and sodic sites) have more bearing on where lawns establish. Similarly, we discuss the relevance of enhanced rates of nitrogen cycling and of sodium levels to lawn maintenance. Grazer community composition and density has considerable significance to grazing lawn dynamics; not all grazers are adapted to foraging on short-grass swards, and differences in body size and relative mouth dimensions determine which species are able to convert tall-grass swards into grazing lawns under different conditions. Hence, we evaluate the roles of different grazers in lawn dynamics, as well as the benefits that grazer populations derive from having access to grazing lawns. The effects of grazing lawns can extend well beyond their borders, due to their influence on grazer densities, behaviour and movements as well as fire spread, intensity and frequency. Variation in the area and proportion of a landscape that is grazing lawn can thus have a profound impact on system dynamics. We provide a conceptual model that summarises grazing lawn dynamics, and identify a rainfall range where we predict grazing lawns to be most prevalent. We also examine the biodiversity associated with grazing lawn systems, and consider their functional contribution to the conservation of this biodiversity. Finally, we assess the utility of grazing lawns as a resource in a rangeland context.},

The original Bacillus subtilis enzyme Type IIIA (XIA) no longer is available and has been replaced by a less effective enzyme. For fiber work, a new enzyme has received AOAC approval and is rapidly displacing other amylases in analytical work. This enzyme is available from Sigma (Number A3306; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). The original publications for NDF and ADF (43, 53) and the Agricultural Handbook 379 (14) are obsolete and of historical interest only. Up to date procedures should be followed. Triethylene glycol has replaced 2-ethoxyethanol because of reported toxicity. Considerable development in regard to fiber methods has occurred over the past 5 yr because of a redefinition of dietary fiber for man and monogastric animals that includes lignin and all polysaccharides resistant to mammalian digestive enzymes. In addition to NDF, new improved methods for total dietary fiber and nonstarch polysaccharides including pectin and β-glucans now are available. The latter are also of interest in rumen fermentation. Unlike starch, their fermentations are like that of cellulose but faster and yield no lactic acid. Physical and biological properties of carbohydrate fractions are more important than their intrinsic composition. © 1991, American Dairy Science Association. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Oak reproduction is characterized by mast seeding with high inter-annual fluctuations in fruit production. Such resource pulses can greatly affect ecosystem functioning and may cause seed consumers to alter their mobility, demography, or diet. Consequences of mast seeding for seed consumers remain poorly understood as their long timescale makes them difficult to study. We investigated impacts of oak mast seeding on the feeding behavior of two sympatric European deer species: red deer (Cervus elaphus) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). We analyzed their rumen content over a 31-year period in tandem with 10 years of data on oak fructification (i.e. 8 years of field monitoring and two modelled years). Acorn production is strongly correlated with consumption by both deer species. In years of high fructification, acorns represent more than 50% and 35% of red and roe deer diet, respectively, confirming assumptions that deer favor acorns when these are available. Red deer eat more acorns than roe deer both between and within years. High acorn production in mast years appears to saturate the capacity of deer to consume acorns. As the proportion of acorns increase in their diet, red deer eat more grasses and less conifer browse. No dietary shift was found for roe deer. By inducing dietary shifts in consumers, oak mast seeding can have cascading effects on ecosystem processes, notably on the damages on conifers caused by red deer and the consequences for forest dynamics.},

   abstract = {The current increase in deer populations in many forests has fostered a growing concern about their impact on forest ecology. Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitchensis) were introduced to Haida Gwaii (British Columbia, Canada) in the late 19th century, and they have dramatically affected the regeneration of woody species in both old- and second-growth forests since then. The lack of recruitment in western redcedar (Thuja plicata) in old-growth forests has been attributed to deer. The objectives of this study were to (1) experimentally confirm that deer browsing causes a lack of western redcedar recruitment and (2) assess the potential for and speed of recovery after a prolonged exclusion of deer. We installed a set of 20 enclosures and monitored them over a period of 8 years from 1997 to 2005. We compared temporal changes in redcedar cover and in the survival and growth of marked seedlings in plots that were or were not accessible to deer. Redcedar cover in the vegetation layer accessible to deer was generally low (from 3 to 5%) but higher inside the enclosures (an average difference of 2.3%). Protected seedlings survived better, were higher, presented more leafed shoots, and had less stems than unprotected individuals, features that suggest that deer were key to the lack of regeneration. However, growth was very slow (protected marked seedlings grew 2.5 cm on average in 8 years) and, under the current conditions, the time required for a protected seedling to escape deer would probably take over two decades. This very slow growth rate under closed canopy conditions probably reflects a gap-phase regeneration strategy and/or sensitivity to competition with other woody species. The combination of a very slow growth with a high palatability and a lack of physical defences, in contrast to the other dominant conifers in this ecosystem, probably explain why redcedar regeneration can be eliminated from old-growth forest by abundant deer populations. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Herbivory alters plant chemistry thereby affecting subsequent palatability for the same or different herbivore species. Balsam fir is an important food for various insect and mammalian herbivores that consume tissues at different times of year. In eastern Canada, intense selective browsing of this tree species by ungulates has impeded natural regeneration of fir-dominated forests. Our objective was to determine whether late-season (simulated) browsing of apical and lateral branches affected the defense chemistry of emerging foliage of balsam fir saplings in the following season. At each of five locations in the vicinity of Gros Morne National Park, western Newfoundland, four browsing treatments were imposed in the late growing season on healthy fir saplings; apical, lateral, apical + lateral, and no browsing. In the following season, newly expanded and previous-year needles were collected shortly after bud break and analyzed for total phenols and condensed tannins. Browsing treatments had no effect on levels of these defense chemicals in either needle age class indicating the lack of an induced chemical response or preferential defense of the apical versus lateral shoots. New foliage appeared to be better defended than previous-year foliage. Neither phenol nor tannin levels were related to canopy closure or height and diameter of saplings; however, foliar phenol concentration was positively related to soil pH for both age classes of fir needle indicating a possible relationship between soil characteristics and plant secondary metabolites. Levels of both phenols and tannins in current-year needles were positively related to those of previous-year needles, whereas the concentration of phenols and tannins were negatively related for previous-year needles only. Our results support the premise that the main antiherbivore strategy of balsam fir is tolerance of intense browsing.},

   abstract = {Given that the rate of resource capture constrains plant growth and defence, understanding the linkage between the leaf economic spectrum (LES) and defence and how it contributes to growth is central to predicting species performance. In spite of the prevalence of spiny plants in many plant communities, little is known about how the LES relates to defence and growth rate across these species. We grew 42 spiny species, from diverse environments, under common garden conditions for 15 weeks and measured LES (leaf N, SLA and assimilation rate), defence and growth traits. We assessed general relationships between LES and growth rate and tested whether structural defences (spines, leaf fibre and lignin content) and quantitative chemical defences (condensed tannins) are linked to the LES and growth and if different spine types (i.e. leaf spines, stipular spines, prickles and thorns), with distinct anatomical origins, partition out across the LES. We observed two independent trait axes that together explained ~68% of trait variation across species. The first axis showed that structural defences (spines, leaf fibre and lignin content) trade off with leaf productivity along the LES. Axis 2 revealed that condensed tannins is orthogonal and less integrated with the LES-structural defence axis. Bivariate trait analyses disclosed positive covariations between LES traits and sapling growth rate. All structural defence traits were negatively related to sapling growth. Across spine types, species with leaf spines were associated with the conservative end of the LES, characterized by high structural defences and lower leaf productivity relative to other spine types. Synthesis: Our study shows that the LES and structural defences are coupled in spiny species such that constitutive growth – defence strategies range from fast-growing species with low allocation to defences to slow-growing species that invest heavily in structural defences (dominated by leaf spiny species).},

   abstract = {Aim: Climate change is known to be a driver of changes in forest plant communities and to modify disturbance regimes. We investigated whether forest gaps favoured vegetation adaptation to warmer climates by accelerating the shift of plant communities to a warmer-adapted composition independently of canopy closure linked to natural forest dynamics. Location: Temperate and mountainous forests of France. Time period: 2002–2018. Major taxa studied: Vascular plants. Methods: Using floristic surveys conducted in 2002 and 2018 in 139 permanent plots set up in unmanaged forest gaps created by windstorms in 1999, we assessed the plant communities’ changes in context of global warming. We also compared gap communities to closed communities inventoried in undisturbed forest. A community temperature index (CTI) and a community light index (CLI) were computed for each floristic survey with species temperature optima and Ellenberg light indicator values, respectively. Results: CTI increased significantly in the gaps over the 16 years by 0.11°C/decade on average. During the same period, the CLI decreased, indicating that community thermophilization was not the direct result of an increase in solar radiation linked to gap creation. Models showed that, after canopy recovery, thermophilization was stronger in mountains (+0.54°C) than lowland sites (+0.12°C) compared to undisturbed forests. The difference between former gaps and undisturbed forests resulted from the colonization of warm adapted species and the decline of cold adapted species in gaps. Main conclusions: For a given canopy closure, our results show that thermophilization of understorey communities is higher in areas with previous disturbances than in undisturbed forests. By increasing the speed of thermophilization, the disturbance regime plays a key role in the adaptation of forest communities to climate warming. The effects of large-scale disturbances on forest plant composition should therefore not be overlooked, especially since disturbance regime tends to intensify with climate change.},

   abstract = {Mixed oak-beech forests are particularly valuable from an ecological and socioeconomic perspective but are increasingly exposed to anthropogenic impacts. We wonder whether anthropogenic change drivers, such as increased drought and ungulate populations affect optimal regeneration niches, species coexistence, and mixed-species forest dynamics. We compared understorey composition, structure and distribution with the overstorey counterpart in an oak-beech forest located at its southernmost European distribution (Central Spain) with increasing drought and ungulate herbivory for the last decades. Results showed that Ilex aquifolium and Prunus avium had greater representation in the recruitment layer as compared to the understorey layer whereas, for the dominant Quercus spp. and Fagus sylvatica, there was a tendency suggesting an expansion of Fagus at the expense of Quercus. Density of tree recruits showed strong differences across microsites. The greatest density was found under tree and under shrub cover whereas the lowest was found under woody debris. By species, Quercus regenerated better in open and shrub microsites whereas Fagus and Ilex regeneration was higher under tree cover. Large patches of shrub cover favoured Prunus avium recruitment, particularly against ungulate herbivory as it was the most heavily browsed species, followed by Quercus, Ilex and Fagus in a descending order. Herbivory occurrence and intensity on tree recruits strongly varied with the microsite, with greater herbivory levels in open microsites. Woody debris on the ground only protected tree recruits from browsing when they were located under tree cover. Overall, fenced areas with no ungulates showed greater tree species coexistence (28% increase in species richness) and recruitment abundance (81% increase) after 7 years of exclusion. We also found a large increase in tree recruit growth and height:diameter ratio (h:d) for all studied species when fenced. Fagus and Prunus avium showed the greatest growth and h:d increase, much greater than those of Quercus and Ilex. The h:d was identified as a reliable indicator of ungulate herbivory and reference values (under null levels of ungulate herbivory) were provided for each species. We conclude that there is an imperative need for adaptive management strategies that address the joint effects of climate change (e.g. increased drought) and ungulate herbivory in mixed oak-beech forests. The provision of different microsites, including patches of shrub cover in open microsites and woody debris under dense tree cover, will facilitate the availability of suitable regeneration niches for most species and will therefore promote future species coexistence.},

The main receptor of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is now undergoing extensive scrutiny to understand the routes of transmission and sensitivity in different species. Here, we utilized a unique dataset of ACE2 sequences from 410 vertebrate species, including 252 mammals, to study the conservation of ACE2 and its potential to be used as a receptor by SARS-CoV-2. We designed a five-category binding score based on the conservation properties of 25 amino acids important for the binding between ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Only mammals fell into the medium to very high categories and only catarrhine primates into the very high category, suggesting that they are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We employed a protein structural analysis to qualitatively assess whether amino acid changes at variable residues would be likely to disrupt ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding and found the number of predicted unfavorable changes significantly correlated with the binding score. Extending this analysis to human population data, we found only rare (frequency <0.001) variants in 10/25 binding sites. In addition, we found significant signals of selection and accelerated evolution in the ACE2 coding sequence across all mammals, and specific to the bat lineage. Our results, if confirmed by additional experimental data, may lead to the identification of intermediate host species for SARS-CoV-2, guide the selection of animal models of COVID-19, and assist the conservation of animals both in native habitats and in human care.},

Yet, theory predicts that in large ecosystems with environmental gradients, shifts should start locally and gradually spread through space. Here we empirically document a spatially propagating shift in the trophic structure of a large aquatic ecosystem, from dominance of large predatory fish (perch, pike) to the small prey fish, the three-spined stickleback. Fish surveys in 486 shallow bays along the 1200 km western Baltic Sea coast during 1979–2017 show that the shift started in wave-exposed archipelago areas near the open sea, but gradually spread towards the wave-sheltered mainland coast. Ecosystem surveys in 32 bays in 2014 show that stickleback predation on juvenile predators (predator–prey reversal) generates a feedback mechanism that appears to reinforce the shift. In summary, managers must account for spatial heterogeneity and dispersal to better predict, detect and confront regime shifts within large ecosystems.},

   abstract = {The importance of herbivore–plant and soil biota–plant interactions in terrestrial ecosystems is amply recognized, but the effects of aboveground herbivores on soil biota remain challenging to predict. To find global patterns in belowground responses to vertebrate herbivores, we performed a meta-analysis of studies that had measured abundance or activity of soil organisms inside and outside field exclosures (areas that excluded herbivores). Responses were often controlled by climate, ecosystem type, and dominant herbivore identity. Soil microfauna and especially root-feeding nematodes were negatively affected by herbivores in subarctic sites. In arid ecosystems, herbivore presence tended to reduce microbial biomass and nitrogen mineralization. Herbivores decreased soil respiration in subarctic ecosystems and increased it in temperate ecosystems, but had no net effect on microbial biomass or nitrogen mineralization in those ecosystems. Responses of soil fauna, microbial biomass, and nitrogen mineralization shifted from neutral to negative with increasing herbivore body size. Responses of animal decomposers tended to switch from negative to positive with increasing precipitation, but also differed among taxa, for instance Oribatida responded negatively to herbivores, whereas Collembola did not. Our findings imply that losses and gains of aboveground herbivores will interact with climate and land use changes, inducing functional shifts in soil communities. To conceptualize the mechanisms behind our findings and link them with previous theoretical frameworks, we propose two complementary approaches to predict soil biological responses to vertebrate herbivores, one focused on an herbivore body size gradient, and the other on a climate severity gradient. Major research gaps were revealed, with tropical biomes, protists, and soil macrofauna being especially overlooked.},

   abstract = {Indirect ecological effects are a common feature of ecological systems, arising when one species affects interactions among two or more other species. We examined how browsing by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) indirectly affected the abundance and composition of a web-building spider guild through their effects on the structure of the ground and shrub layers of northern hardwood forests. We examined paired plots consisting of deer-free and control plots in the Allegheny Plateau region Pennsylvania and Northern Highlands region of Wisconsin. We recorded the abundance of seven types of webs, each corresponding to a family of web-building spiders. We quantified vegetation structure and habitat suitability for the spiders by computing a web scaffold availability index (WSAI) at 0.5 m and 1.0 m above the ground. At Northern Highlands sites, we recorded prey availability. Spider webs were twice as abundant in deer-free plots compared to control plots, while WSAI was 7-12 times greater in deerfree plots. Prey availability was lower in deer-free plots. With the exception of funnel web-builders, all spider web types were significantly more abundant in deer-free plots. Both deer exclusion and the geographic region of plots were significant predictors of spider community structure. In closed canopy forests with high browsing pressure, the low density of tree saplings and shrubs provides few locations for web-building spiders to anchor webs. Recruitment of these spiders may become coupled with forest disturbance events that increase tree and shrub recruitment. By modifying habitat structure, deer appear to indirectly modify arthropod food web interactions. As deer populations have increased in eastern North America over the past several decades, the effects of deer on web-building spiders may be widespread.},

   abstract = {Background: Livestock grazing and 'overabundance' of large wild herbivores in forested areas have long been perceived as conflicting with the aims of both silviculture and forest conservation; however, certain kinds of herbivory can help to maintain habitat values in forest ecosystems. Management of mammalian herbivory in protected forests can, therefore, be a critical tool for biodiversity conservation. The primary aim of this systematic review was to examine how forest vegetation and invertebrates are affected by manipulation of the grazing/browsing pressure by livestock or wild ungulates. The ultimate purpose was to investigate whether such manipulation is useful for conserving or restoring biodiversity in forest set-asides. Methods: We considered studies of manipulated ungulate herbivory in forests anywhere within the boreal and temperate zones, not only in protected areas but also in production forest. Non-intervention or alternative levels of intervention were used as comparators. Relevant outcomes included abundance, diversity and composition of plants and invertebrates, tree regeneration, and performance of focal/target species. Studies were mainly selected from a recent systematic map of the evidence on biodiversity effects of forest management relevant to protected areas. Additional studies were identified through updated searches online and in bibliographies of existing reviews. Relevant studies were critically appraised, and studies with low or unclear validity were excluded from the review. Quantitative outcomes were extracted from 103 articles, and summary effect sizes were derived by meta-analysis. Results: Most of the 144 studies included in the review had been conducted in North America, Europe or Australia/New Zealand. The intervention most commonly studied was experimental exclusion (or enclosure) of wild and/or domestic ungulates by fencing. Other studies examined culling of wild ungulates or compared forests long grazed by livestock to ungrazed forests. Effects on vegetation and invertebrates were reported in 135 and 23 of the studies, respectively. We found negative responses to herbivory in the abundance of understorey vegetation as a whole, woody understorey and bryophytes, and also in the species richness of woody understorey vegetation, whereas the richness of forbs and bryophytes responded positively. Several effects depended on ungulate origins: Understorey abundance responded negatively to livestock and to ungulates introduced into the wild, but not to native ones. In contrast, understorey species richness responded positively to livestock but not to wild ungulates. The duration and intensity of herbivory had few significant effects on vegetation - exceptions included woody understorey abundance and richness, which decreased with increasing duration and intensity, respectively. Among invertebrates we found negative responses to herbivory in the abundance of lepidopterans and spiders, but no significant effects on species richness. Conclusions: Our review revealed a large body of high-validity experimental studies on impacts of ungulate herbivory in forests. This evidence confirmed that manipulation of such herbivory is often highly influential on tree regeneration and on the abundance, diversity and composition of understorey vegetation. Nevertheless, we also identified important knowledge gaps - we found few studies of boreal areas, long-term herbivory effects, impacts on bryophytes, lichens and invertebrates, and effects of manipulation less radical than total exclusion of ungulates.},

   abstract = {Herbivorous ungulates are key species in the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, and their recent demographic and geographic expansion in some temperate regions is likely to influence ecological processes, particularly if we consider plants and the frequency of mobile links among plant populations. In forests, long-distance seed dispersal essentially relies on animal movements. Owing to their ability to cover daily long distances, large herbivorous ungulates are assumed to be important vectors for long-distance seed dispersal (hundreds to thousands of metres). To quantify patterns of seed dispersal, we analysed the paths of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), red deer (Cervus elaphus) and wild boar (Sus scrofa) which had been equipped with GPS collars. We used seed gut passage times from a recent companion paper (Picard et al., Ecology and Evolution, 2015;5:2621-2632). We combined the animal movements and seed gut passage times to estimate seed dispersal curves for herbivorous ungulates. On average, the forest ungulates might disperse consumed seeds over distances greater than 2 km, during a 48-h path in the forest. Maximal dispersal distance was longer for red deer (3.5 km) and wild boar (3.2 km) than for roe deer (2.0 km). By combining high excretion rates and long dispersal distance, wild boar appears to be potentially an efficient seed disperser. Seed dispersal by common herbivorous ungulates is likely to play a crucial role in the today's context of rapid environmental changes such as global warming and landscape fragmentation. Differences in the distribution of seed gut passage times and seasonal distances covered underline the relevance of cross comparative approaches and the complementarity of herbivorous ungulates in long-distance seed dispersal.},

   abstract = {Climate change is altering patterns of seed production worldwide [1–4], but the potential for evolutionary responses to these changes is poorly understood. Masting (synchronous, annually variable seed production by plant populations) is selectively beneficial through economies of scale that decrease the cost of reproduction per surviving offspring [5–7]. Masting is particularly widespread in temperate trees [8, 9] impacting food webs, macronutrient cycling, carbon storage, and human disease risk [10–12], so understanding its response to climate change is important. Here, we analyze inter-individual variability in plant reproductive patterns and two economies of scale—predator satiation and pollination efficiency—and document how natural selection acting upon them favors masting. Four decades of observations for European beech (Fagus sylvatica) show that predator satiation and pollination efficiency select for individuals with higher inter-annual variability of reproduction and higher reproductive synchrony between individuals. This result confirms the long-standing theory that masting, a population-level phenomenon, is generated by selection on individuals. Furthermore, recent climate-driven increases in mean seed production have increased selection pressure from seed predators but not from pollination efficiency. Natural selection is thus acting to restore the fitness benefits of masting, which have previously decreased under a warming climate [13]. However, selection will likely take far longer (centuries) than climate warming (decades), so in the short-term, tree reproduction will be reduced because masting has become less effective at satiating seed predators. Over the long-term, evolutionary responses to climate change could potentially increase inter-annual variability of seed production of masting species.},

   abstract = {Browsing damage by ungulates is among the most decisive factors affecting the establishment and growth of young trees. In recent decades, ungulate populations have been expanding in the Northern Hemisphere; impairment of tree regeneration by their activity is an increasing problem. Herbivore-induced changes in tree regeneration may alter the composition and biodiversity of the future tree stand. In this study we determined where young trees can leave the seedling bank and succeed to higher forest strata in a protected natural forest that is under strong herbivore pressure. We studied rowan (Sorbus aucuparia) regeneration in a subalpine spruce forest growing in a strictly protected area of Babia Góra National Park (Western Carpathians). Rowan is one of the most palatable forest species, so browsing can significantly limit its growth. We predicted that factors, that restrict the movement of red deer (Cervus elaphus), decrease their visits in some forest patches, which will result in a higher share of rowan saplings. We also considered two other factors that can affect the distribution of rowan saplings: light availability and distance to maternal trees. In particular, we tested whether the occurrence of rowan saplings was related to: (i) slope angle, amount of logs lying on the forest floor, and distance to the hiking trails; (ii) distance to fruit-bearing trees; and (iii) canopy openness. The results confirmed our main predictions concerning the relation between the occurrence of palatable tree saplings and the availability of a forest area to ungulates. Factors related to the availability of terrain to red deer significantly influenced the distribution of rowan saplings taller than 1 m. The probability of rowan sapling occurrence increased when the amount of logs was higher and the distance to hiking trails was shorter. Slope had a significant negative impact on sapling occurrence. We found no effect of proximity of fruit-bearing rowan trees or canopy gap area. Thus, in the natural forest, the likelihood that young palatable trees will make the transition from seedlings to taller saplings seems to be determined mainly by factors related to ungulate activity. This suggests that the increase of ungulate populations and their browsing behavior will affect the species composition and spatial structure of future tree stands.},

   abstract = {Wild large herbivores are declining worldwide. Despite extensive use of exclosure experiments to investigate herbivore impacts, there is little consensus on the effects of wild large herbivores on ecosystem function. Of the ecosystem functions likely impacted, we reviewed the five most-studied in exclosure experiments: ecosystem resilience/resistance to disturbance, nutrient cycling, carbon cycling, plant regeneration, and primary productivity. Experimental data on large wild herbivores' effects on ecosystem functions were predominately derived from temperate grasslands (50% grasslands, 75% temperate zones). Additionally, data were from experiments that may not be of adequate size (median size 400 m2 despite excluding all experiments below 25 m2) or duration (median duration 6 years) to capture ecosystem-scale responses to these low-density and wide-ranging taxa. Wild herbivore removal frequently impacted ecosystem functions; for example, net carbon uptake increased by three times in some instances. However, the magnitude and direction of effects, even within a single function, were highly variable. A focus on carbon cycling highlighted challenges in interpreting effects on a single function. While the effect of large herbivore exclusion on carbon cycling was slightly positive when its components (e.g. pools vs. fluxes of carbon) were aggregated, effects on individual components were variable and sometimes opposed. Given modern declines in large wild herbivores, it is critical to understand their effects on ecosystem function. However, this synthesis highlights strong variability in direction, magnitude, and modifiers of these effects. Some variation is likely due to disparity in what components are used to describe a given function. For example, for the carbon cycle we identified eight distinctly meaningful components, which are not easily combined yet are potentially misrepresentative of the larger cycle when considered alone. However, much of the observed difference in responses likely reflects real ecological variability across complex systems. To move towards a general predictive framework we must identify where variation in effect is due to methodological differences and where due to ecosystem context. Two critical steps forward are (a) additional quantitative synthetic analyses of large herbivores' effects on individual functions, and (b) improved, increased systematic exclosure research focusing on effects of large herbivores' exclusion on functions.

   abstract = {To understand how large herbivores interact with their food resources and the ecosystem, it is necessary to understand plant growth responses to biomass loss. Tolerance to biomass loss, and the ability to regrow new photosynthetic tissue after herbivore attack, is one such important mechanism. Here we experimentally studied how year-round browsing corresponding to four different levels of moose, Alces alces, population density affected total annual browse biomass production, which also serves as a proxy for production of new photosynthetic tissue, in birch (Betula pubescens and B. pendula) and Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris, along a habitat productivity gradient. Our results revealed that habitat productivity index was the most important variable determining annual browse biomass production for birch, and that a high moose density and biomass removals of 25-40% annually actually could stimulate birch above-ground productivity in more productive sites. Contrary to birch, pine was not affected by habitat productivity index, and appeared to have much lower regrowth capacity than birch. For pine, percent biomass removed was the most important factor affecting annual browse biomass production, which decreased with increasing levels of biomass removal. We also tested if birch and pine responded to biomass removal by allocating more resources to browse biomass production at in the lower portion of the stem (0-0.5 m), which was protected from biomass removal in winter. Birch did not allocate more resources to biomass production in the lower portion of the stem, whereas pines subjected to high biomass removal had more biomass in the lower portion of the stem than those protected from losses. Our study thus shows that plant responses can be linear or non-linear along the range of herbivore densities we studied, and that responses can change from negative to positive along underlying habitat productivity gradients.},

Here we show that key vegetation resources attract herbivores, and the surrounding vegetation receives a higher impact than if it is associated with patches of less preferred vegetation (an example of apparent competition). We studied the influence of proximity to preferred grass patches on utilization of the less preferred dwarf shrub, heather (Calluna vulgaris) by red deer (Cervus elaphus) and sheep (Ovis aries) at a range of spatial scales in the Cairngorm Mountains of Scotland, UK. There was a sharp decline in heather utilization with increasing distance from the edges of grass patches. The proportion of grass in the local landscape (within 1 km) had a significant positive effect on heather utilization both at the grass-heather boundary and beyond 5 m from the grass patch. There was also a significant effect of dominant grass species on the utilization of heather within 50 cm of the grass-patch edge, with utilization around Agrostis/Festuca patches (most, preferred) being greater than around Nardus-dominated patches, and lowest around patches of Molinia. The greatest contribution to variation in heather utilization was at the smallest scale, and variance components decreased as spatial scale increased, making it impossible to predict local heather utilization (i.e., at the scale of individual plants and of individual bites by foraging ungulates) from large-scale parameters alone, such as herbivore density. These findings emphasize that vegetation-herbivore interactions are localized within the landscape, and that it is these hot spots which are the key fulcrum for vegetation dynamics.},

   abstract = {Damage to young trees as a result of browsing by deer, can lead to significant loss of revenue in commercial forestry plantations. This study investigated the chemical and morphological characteristics of Sitka spruce saplings which influenced their susceptibility to browsing. Specifically, we tested whether genetic variability in monoterpene content of saplings affected deer feeding behaviour. Clonal cuttings of Sitka spruce were grown for 5 years following propagation from 15 parent trees growing on the West Coast of Scotland. Monoterpene concentrations and morphological characteristics of individual saplings were recorded prior to offering them to a group of tame red deer hinds in a series of preference trials, conducted within an experimental enclosure on a moorland site in northeast Scotland. Browsing intensity was assessed after each trial by recording the number of distinct signs of damage on each tree. Results showed that a high proportion of variation in browsing damage could be attributed to inter-trial variability, possibly due to increasing familiarity with the Sitka saplings as the experiment progressed. However, individual saplings were found to differ in their susceptibility to browsing according to predictable criteria: height had a positive influence on browsing damage while monoterpene concentration had a negative influence. The different clones also varied in the amount of damage they received, and between-clone variation in monoterpene concentration was an important factor in explaining variation in preference. These results demonstrate the important genetic influence on susceptibility of Sitka spruce to browsing damage by red deer and suggest that foresters may be able to exploit genetic variation in monoterpene concentrations to improve the resistance of Sitka spruce to deer browsing. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

After a further year of growth, the selection and browsing behaviour of red deer on damaged and undamaged trees were studied in a controlled experiment. Morphological and chemical analysis of ten trees from each treatment combination showed that damaged trees were significantly smaller after one year than undamaged trees but had longer needles. Chemical composition was not affected by browsing. High fertiliser addition increased most size parameters and increased the nutritive value of trees. The preference for previously damaged and undamaged trees was compared in a series Of thirty two trials. On eight separate occasions, four red deer hinds were individually offered the choice of two damaged and two undamaged trees in an experimental enclosure. During each trial, biomass removed, number of bites removed, duration of browsing, intake rate, and mean bite weight at each tree were recorded. Biomass removed, bites taken and time spent at trees were significantly greater for previously undamaged trees than for damaged teees. All three variables were also positively related to the height of each tree and the number of lateral branches on each tree. The greater foraging effort on undamaged trees was not fully accounted for by the morphology of trees or their chemical composition. It is suggested that increased needle length caused animals to stop feeding sooner and hence led to less browsing damage in previously damaged trees. The results imply that previously observed localised browsing damage in forestry plantations is unlikely to be the result of changes to the plant induced by previous browsing damage.},

   abstract = {Red deer cause heavy damage to forest production, hence the need to better understand what determines their dietary choices. Deer are selective herbivores. According to the optimal foraging theory (OFT), they should select foods that maximise their net rate of energy gain. For a given nutritional quality, we predict that plant architecture and height should affect deer feeding preferences through intake rate variations. In the first experiment, 12 tame red deer with shoulder height (SH) ranging from 82 to 105 cm were individually offered fresh bunches of Salix caprea at seven heights regularly spaced from 25 to 205 cm. Animals preferred bunches at 85 and 115 cm height (29 and 32% of feeding time). There was a positive relationship between average consumption height (CH) and animal shoulder height (CH = 0.99 × SH; r2 = 0.43; P < 0.05) but intake rate did not change with consumption height. In the second experiment, 10 fresh bunches of Quercus pedunculata were offered on three wooden structures, resembling a bushy topped (BT), a normal (N) and a five-shoot (FS) oak sapling. For each structure, average bunch height was set at preferred consumption height. Five tame hinds were observed during individual cafeteria trials (double- then triple-choice). Intake rate was slightly higher for FS than for the other structures (FS = 23.7 g DM/min, N = 22.3 g DM/min and BT = 22.0 g DM/min). Preferences were expressed as the proportion of feeding time during the first min of test. In the double-choice trials, preference was higher for FS relative to BT (61%-39%), and for N relative to BT (62%-38%), but similar between FS and N (57%-43%). In the triple-choice trials, preference for FS (44%), N (24%) and BT (32%) differed from 33%-33%-33%. In both trials, there was thus a slight preference for FS, i.e. for the structure where all bunches were widely spaced and at the hinds' preferred height. Foliage height and, to a lesser extent, structure of saplings thus affect the feeding preferences of red deer.

Environmental factors determine the type and intensity of these consumers globally, but the traits of plants can also alter their propensity to burn and the degree to which they are eaten. To understand plant life-history strategies associated with fire and herbivory we need to describe both response and effect functional traits, and how they sort within communities, along resource gradients, and across evolutionary timescales. Fire and herbivore functional traits are generally considered separately, but there are advances made in understanding fire that relate to herbivory, and vice versa. Moreover, fire and herbivory interact: the presence of one consumer affects the type and intensity of the other. Here, we present a unifying conceptual framework to understand plant strategies that enable tolerance and persistence to fire and herbivory. Using grasses as an example, we discuss how flammability and fire tolerance, palatability, and grazing tolerance traits might organize themselves in ecosystems exposed to these consumers, and how these traits might have evolved with reference to other strong selective processes, like aridity. Our framework can be used to predict both the diversity of life-history strategies and plant species diversity under different consumer regimes.},

Altogether 150 feeding stations, each with six different seedling types, were established in ordinary clear - cuts in east - central Sweden. The seedling types used were three each of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), 1 - year - old and 2 - year - old containerized seedlings, and 2 - year - old bare-rooted seedlings. The planting took place in autumn. After one winter, browsing of the various seedling types was recorded. Number of browsed seedlings, leader browsing, and bite diameter differed between seedling types. Results showed that pine was more browsed than spruce, 2 - year - old seedlings more browsed than 1 - year - old seedlings, and containerized seedlings more browsed than bare - rooted seedlings. Morphological characteristics varied between the six seedling types. Few significant correlations between morphology and browsing were found, although the number of browsed seedlings and mean bite diameter were positively correlated with apical stem diameter. © 1999 Scandinavian University Press.},

The study's aim was to quantify the development of two competitive species (Rubus idaeus and Cytisus scoparius) present in the chaîne des Puys, France, relatively to light in gaps inside Picea abies stands. On 29 transects linking the stand to the gap centre (223 points), light intensity was measured (0-80% of relative light) and floristic measurements (cover and height of the different species) were done. Development of both competitive species is positively connected to light, with a bell-shaped curve with a maximum of 40-50% for R. idaeus and a quite constant increase to 80% (maximum of light recorded in the experimentation) for C. scoparius.

In this investigation, vascular plants in the ground flora were observed before and after thinning to create plots with target basal areas of 20, 15 and 10m2 ha1 within a semi-natural Fraxinus excelsior woodland: treatments to exclude deer and control bramble (Rubus fruticosus) were also applied. Although 45 new species appeared only 26 remained 5 years after thinning; their cover was often 1-2%. Before thinning 38 herbaceous species were present and although only one of these disappeared the frequency of most common species declined in plots without bramble control. In contrast, on plots with bramble control the frequency of some species increased significantly and 40-50% more species were present after 5 years. Species richness after thinning was positively related to the initial species richness and in general negatively related to bramble height and basal area of adjacent trees. Results suggest that silvicultural practices which maintain partial canopy cover should be avoided on some sites as the development of dense bramble cover can have adverse effects on the woodland ground flora present before harvesting.},

The stand was differentially thinned to obtain a gradient of transmitted photosynthetically active radiation (PARt; 0-0.35). Eighteen Fagus saplings were sampled in this gradient, and their growth (basal stem diameter increment) was recorded over six years. Over the same period, morphological parameters (leaf area, number and arrangement in space) were monitored by 3D-digitization. Photosynthetic parameters were estimated with a portable gas-exchange analyzer. Photosynthesis was mainly related to light availability, whereas sapling morphology was mainly driven by sapling size. Annual stem diameter increment was related to the amount of light-intercepting foliage (silhouette to total leaf area ratio (STAR) x total sapling leaf area (LA)) and light availability above the saplings (PARt). However, light-use efficiency, i.e., the slope of the relationship between STAR x LA x PARt and stem diameter increment, decreased over time as a result of a relative decrease in the proportion of photosynthetic tissues to total sapling biomass. © 2007 Heron Publishing.},

   abstract = {Central European temperate oak woodlands are highly valued for their rich biodiversity. They are also of great economic importance and forest management aims to produce high quality timber, which demands high investments. The aim of this literature review is to identify management options for forestry and nature conservation that sustain both the ecological value of oak forests and the economic viability of oak silviculture. We addressed three main questions: (a) Oaks and close-to-nature forestry – what are the key silvicultural challenges and options?, (b) What is the particular significance of ecological continuity and which structural features are of importance for biodiversity conservation in oak forests?, (c) What are the key elements and possible strategies of forest management that sustain the ecological values in oak forests in combination with viable forestry? Light availability appeared to be a conspicuous link connecting the conservation and the silvicultural aspects of multifunctional oak forest management: Both young oak trees and multiple oak woodland specialist species are characterized by their need for increased sunlight exposure. This common denominator provides a sound basis for integrative management practices for forestry and nature conservation. The concept of retention forestry offers purposeful approaches. So the harvest of valuable timber oaks or the creation of canopy gaps for oak regeneration can be used to release the crowns and trunks of habitat oaks from shading and competition. When looking at the management of oak woodland biodiversity hotspots, the re-establishment of (modified) historical forest management techniques, which increase stand openness and create transitional habitats that provide suitable oak regeneration niches, seems to be necessary. Not only the continuity of oak woodland cover and natural site conditions, but also the uninterrupted temporal continuity and availability of wood-related structural features turned out to be of particular importance for oak woodland specialist species. We identified an urgent need for systematic forest planning approaches that secure the long-term availability of these structural features within areas or “sustainability units” that are large enough to maintain viable populations of oak woodland specialist species. In particular, conservation-oriented forestry measures should mainly be implemented in those areas, where the greatest effectiveness is to be expected. In the sustainability units, oak regeneration measures ought to take place either in close vicinity to old oak stands or directly in these stands. The choice of one of these options should be based on a careful consideration of the needs and possibilities of both silvicultural and nature conservation management.},

   abstract = {Quantitative aspects of the study of animal and human behaviour are increasingly relevant to test hypotheses and find empirical support for them. At the same time, photo and video cameras can store a large number of video recordings and are often used to monitor the subjects remotely. Researchers frequently face the need to code considerable quantities of video recordings with relatively flexible software, often constrained by species-specific options or exact settings. BORIS is a free, open-source and multiplatform standalone program that allows a user-specific coding environment to be set for a computer-based review of previously recorded videos or live observations. Being open to user-specific settings, the program allows a project-based ethogram to be defined that can then be shared with collaborators, or can be imported or modified. Projects created in BORIS can include a list of observations, and each observation may include one or two videos (e.g. simultaneous screening of visual stimuli and the subject being tested; recordings from different sides of an aquarium). Once the user has set an ethogram, including state or point events or both, coding can be performed using previously assigned keys on the computer keyboard. BORIS allows definition of an unlimited number of events (states/point events) and subjects. Once the coding process is completed, the program can extract a time-budget or single or grouped observations automatically and present an at-a-glance summary of the main behavioural features. The observation data and time-budget analysis can be exported in many common formats (TSV, CSV, ODF, XLS, SQL and JSON). The observed events can be plotted and exported in various graphic formats (SVG, PNG, JPG, TIFF, EPS and PDF).},

   abstract = {Solar radiation transmission in forest stands affects many processes, including biomass and diversity of understorey vegetation and tree seedling regeneration (growth and morphogenesis). However, understorey light availability is not easy for forest managers or scientists to measure. Therefore, different models have been developed to predict light transmission in forest stands according to tree or stand structure. However, these models are generally too complex to be used operationally. This paper reports the assessment of light transmission according to stand parameters commonly measured by foresters in inventories. We measured transmittance in 29 even-aged oak stands in France for various wavebands, total solar radiation (TSR, 300-3000 nm), PAR (400-700 nm), red (R, 660 nm) and far-red (FR, 730 nm), and demonstrated that transmittance in a given waveband can be predicted from the measurement of another waveband. The R:FR ratio can be predicted according to TSR or PAR transmittance, but the opposite is also true; PAR or TSR transmittance can be predicted from the R:FR ratio. Transmittance variability was characterised, and the variation coefficient ranged from 5 to 45% with a trend to increase with tree density. By analogy to Beer-Lambert's law, we established that mean daily transmittance for the different wavebands can be assessed according to stand basal area and stand age with good accuracy (R2>0.74). Results are discussed in comparison with other models based on the principle of parsimony. © Springer-Verlag 2006.},

Before the first severe defoliation, in July 1993, performance of M. lapponica larvae in plots with a high beetle density was either better or the same as in low-density plots. However, in 1994 and 1995, the years following severe willow defoliation in high-density plots. M. lapponica performance (in terms of survival, developmental time and beetle weight) decreased with increasing beetle density. Retarded larval growth in high-density plots was related to a decreased consumption rate, whereas the efficiency of the conversion of ingested food was similar in high- and low-density plots. These results indicate that defoliation triggered delayed induced resistance in S. borealis. Leaf fluctuating asymmetry (FA, a non-specific stress indicator) of this willow species in 1992 was similar in low- and high-density plots, but it increased in high-density plots in 1994, at the same time that detrimental effects on beetle performance were recorded at these sites. Plot-specific indices of beetle performance and FA were negatively correlated both in 1994 and 1995, suggesting that plants stressed by defoliation the previous-year were less favourable for leaf beetles.},

   abstract = {Both mechanical damage to mountain birch foliage and rearing of moth larvae on the trees reduced the growth of Epirrita autumnata larvae reared on these trees in the following year. The effects of physical damage and some other cues from insects were additive. On bird cherry the performance of Epirrita larvae was equal on untreated trees and on trees artificially defoliated in the previous year, but larval growth was reduced on previously insect-damaged branches. With mountain ash just physical damage per se reduced the performance of Epirrita larvae. On Salix phylicifolia there were no significant differences in the growth or survival of Epirrita on untreated control bushes and on bushes with partial larval damage during the previous year. Among untreated control trees the growth and survivorship of Epirrita were higher on fast-growing willow and bird cherry than on the slow-growing mountain birch. Mountain birch and mountain ash, the two deciduous tree species adapted to nutrient-poor soils, showed delayed inducible resistance triggered by defoliation (artificial or insect-made). This supports the hypothesis that delayed inducible resistance may be a passive response due to nutrient-stress caused by defoliation. On the other hand, the additional increase in the resistance of mountain birch triggered by specific cues from insects suggests that this response may be an evolved defense against leaf-eating insects. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.},

I tested EEH using the pattern of deer biomass distribution over North America, the dominant family of large herbivores. Deer biomass increased from the High Arctic to the north of the boreal forest and remained in the same range southward within the gray wolf range; for the same latitude, deer biomass increased by a factor of 5 in the absence of wolves. South of the wolf range, there existed a clear relationship between actual evapotranspiration, a proxy of primary productivity, and deer biomass. Highest deer densities occurred in the south-east of the continent where only white-tailed deer are present. The observed pattern lends support to EEH and suggests that the removal of large predators in southern North America may have imposed an unprecedented pressure on plants eaten by deer.},

   abstract = {Herbivores are constitutive elements of most terrestrial ecosystems. Understanding effects of herbivory on ecosystem dynamics is thus a major, albeit challenging task in community ecology. Effects of mammals on plant communities are typically explored by comparing plant densities or diversity in exclosure experiments. This might over-estimate long-term herbivore effects at community levels as early life stage mortality is driven by a multitude of factors. Addressing these challenges, we established a set of 100 pairs of ungulate exclosures and unfenced control plots (25 m2) in mixed montane forests in the Alps in 1989 covering a forest area of 90 km2. Investigations ran until 2013. Analogous to the gap-maker–gap-filler approach, dynamically recording the height of the largest trees per tree species in paired plots with and without exclosures might allow for assessing herbivore impacts on those individuals with a high probability of attaining reproductive stages. We thus tested if recording maximum heights of regenerating trees would better reflect effects of ungulate herbivory on long-term dynamics of tree regeneration than recording of stem density, and if species dominance patterns would shift over time. For quantifying the effects of ungulate herbivory simultaneously at community and species level we used principle response curves (PRC). PRCs yielded traceable results both at community and species level. Trajectories of maximum heights yielded significant results contrary to trajectories of total stem density. Response patterns of tree species were not uniform over time: e.g., both Norway spruce and European larch switched in their response to fencing. Fencing explained about 3% of the variance of maximum tree heights after nine years but increased to about 10% after 24 years thus confirming the importance of long-term surveys. Maximum height dynamics of tree species, addressed in our study, can thus reflect local dominance of tree species via asymmetric plant competition. Such effects, both within and among forest patches, can accrue over time shaping forest structure and composition.},

   abstract = {Long-lived trees experience different levels of damage due to mammalian herbivores. To untangle the mechanisms that underlie this variation, we combined chemical with dendrochronological analyses to study variation in browsing on Western redcedars (Thuja plicata) on Haida Gwaii (British Columbia, Canada). Since the last glaciation, Haida Gwaii forests had lacked large herbivore browser until Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis) were introduced at the beginning of the 20th century. Dendrochronology yielded information on radial growth and plant annual responses to environmental stresses including herbivory. Secondary metabolite content and plant nutritional quality provided insights into proximate causes of food choices made by herbivores. We sampled lightly- and heavily-browsed young trees at four sites: three clear-cut sites with high browsing pressure and one old-growth forest site where browsing pressure had, until recently, been lower. Heavily-browsed young trees had lower concentrations of secondary metabolites and were of lower nutritive value than lightly-browsed trees at all sites. Under high browsing pressure, tree growth patterns suggested that all young trees were initially severely browsed until some trees, currently scored as lightly-browsed, started to escape deer. At the old-growth site, both lightly- and heavily-browsed trees tended to have lower overall average secondary metabolite concentrations than those of all other sites, a trend possibly related to greater canopy closure. Lightly-browsed trees were older than heavily-browsed ones which resulted, during the period of lower browsing pressure, in higher growth rate and a same pattern of change in growth from one year to the next year. This suggests that, under low browsing pressure, selection of young trees related to chemical defense was weak and that growth differences due to other factors than browsing could be expressed. Under strong browsing pressure, however, all young trees had equally low growth rates until trees with better genetic potential to produce effective defenses were able to escape deer. This suggests that selection by deer could occur on a long-lived tree.},

   abstract = {Plant species allocate resources to multiple defensive traits simultaneously, often leading to so-called defence syndromes (i.e. suites of traits that are co-expressed across several species). While reports of ontogenetic variation in plant defences are commonplace, no study to date has tested for ontogenetic shifts in defence syndromes, and we know little about the ecological and evolutionary drivers of variation in plant defence syndromes across ontogeny. We tested for ontogenetic variation in plant defence syndromes by measuring a suite of defensive and nutritional traits on saplings and adult trees of 29 oak (Quercus, Fagaceae) species distributed across Europe, North America, and Asia. In addition, we investigated if these syndromes exhibited a phylogenetic signal to elucidate the nature of their macro-evolutionary variation, whether they were associated with levels of herbivore pressure and climatic conditions, and if any such evolutionary and ecological patterns were contingent on ontogeny. Our analyses revealed three distinct oak defence syndromes: the first included species with high defences, the second species with high defences and low nutrient levels, and the third species with high nutrients and thinner leaves. Interestingly, these defence syndromes remained virtually unchanged across the two ontogenetic stages sampled. In addition, our analyses indicated no evidence for a phylogenetic signal in oak syndromes, a result consistent across ontogenetic stages. Finally, with respect to ecological factors, we found no effect of climatic conditions on defences for either ontogenetic stage, whereas defence syndromes were associated with differing levels of herbivory in adults but not saplings suggesting an association between herbivore pressure and syndrome type that is contingent on ontogeny. Synthesis. Together, these findings indicate that defence syndromes remain remarkably consistent across oak ontogenetic stages, are evolutionarily labile, and while they appear unrelated to climate, they do appear to be associated with herbivory levels in an ontogenetic-dependent manner. Overall, this study builds towards a better understanding of ecological and evolutionary factors underlying multivariate plant defensive phenotypes.},

Here we examine the effects of deer density (>30 years differences in density between two landowners), site productivity (site index, SI) and stand age on subcanopy vegetation characteristics in 60 closed canopy, clear-cut origin Populus tremuloides dominated stands, Michigan, USA. Stand age effects were included because age varied among stands and can affect subcanopy vegetation patterns. Compared with fewer deer, stands with more deer had greater total forest floor vegetation mass, and its major components bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum), sedge (mostly Carex pensylvanica) and trees/shrubs <0.25. m tall, but lower forb mass and lower forest floor vegetation species richness and diversity. Deer density and SI had strong interacting effects on total forest floor mass, forb mass, and species richness. Forb mass increased with SI, but only in stands with fewer deer, whilst total vegetation mass was greater in stands with more deer at lower SI and declined with SI more sharply than for stands with fewer deer. Species richness increased with SI but more so at lower than higher deer density. Deer density and age had interacting effects on mass of trees/shrubs <0.25. m tall and sedge. Compared with fewer deer, stands with more deer had greater sedge and tree/shrub mass, and sedge mass decreased and tree/shrub mass increased more sharply with age. In lower deer stands there was a dense subcanopy tree and shrub strata within and beyond the reach of deer 0.9-10. m tall whereas in higher deer stands this vegetation layer was nearly absent. We conclude that higher deer browse pressure in early successional Populus stands (1) strongly limits the recruitment of woody stems to larger (>0.9. m tall) size classes, which could affect long-term successional trajectories, and (2) diminishes forb density and species richness, especially at higher site productivity, but increases total forest floor vegetation mass (mostly bracken fern and sedge), especially at lower site productivity. Given associations of bracken fern and sedge with poorer and/or more open sites and assuming high palatability of forbs, this pattern may result from the combination of selective herbivory and higher light availability caused by limited recruitment of trees and shrubs to taller strata. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Species range limits are thought to result from a decline in demographic performance because of unsuitable climate at the edges. However, recent studies reporting contradictory patterns in tree species demographic performance at their edges cast doubt on our ability to predict climate change impacts on species ranges. Here we parameterised integral projection models with climate and competition effects for 27 tree species using forest inventory data from over 90,000 plots across Europe. Then, we predicted growth, survival, lifespan, and passage time – the time to grow to a large size – at the hot and cold edges and compared them to the range centre. We found that while growth and passage time of European tree species are constrained at their cold edge, survival and lifespan are constrained at their hot edge. Our study shows a more complicated picture than previously thought with demographic responses that differ between hot and cold edges.},

   abstract = {Using data from 20 even-aged and homogeneous mature beech and oak study plots in Flanders (Northern Belgium), an analysis of the empirical relationships between the rates of leaf area index (LAI) change throughout the leaf development of 2008 and stand, site and meteorological variables was performed. Species-specific multiple linear regressions were fitted between the rates of LAI change and the predictors for two distinct periods from April until August. After a sharp increase in LAI following budburst, the seasonal LAI development for both species showed a marked period of stationary LAI development over all study plots. The cause for the cessation of LAI growth was assumed to be the decline of air temperature and radiation during this period. Later on, the rate of LAI development restarted similarly in every plot. The influence of weather on LAI development was high and its effects were different between species, with beech mostly affected by radiation and oak negatively related to minimal and maximal values of air temperature. Furthermore, our analysis suggested that stand structural (tree density and stand basal area for both species) and tree growth characteristics (average tree-ring width ratio for oak) variables were major drivers of the LAI development during early spring. Later during the growth period, stand variables became less predominant in affecting LAI development. Site quality variables affected LAI development to a lesser extent. The seasonal LAI development was found very similar among stands. This study adds a more accurate and comprehensive approach to the modelling of LAI development during leaf growth of two important European temperate deciduous forest species. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

   abstract = {Post-dispersal seed predation can cause an important "bottleneck" in the natural regeneration of many oak populations. In this study, we experimentally quantified post-dispersal seed predation for two oak species - Quercus canariensis and Quercus suber - coexisting in a Mediterranean forest located in southern Spain. Acorn predation was monitored for 2 consecutive years in two different forest sites, with a total of 3360 acorns experimentally dispersed among different types of microhabitat. Most of the acorns were removed (probably by rodents) and assumed to be consumed. Patterns of post-dispersal acorn predation varied depending on various factors. There was a significant effect of oak species, Q. suber acorns being removed faster and in a higher proportion than those of Q. canariensis. There were also significant effects of burial and microhabitat: the highest predation rates occurred for acorns set on the ground surface (not buried), and especially in the most-densely vegetated microhabitats, where rodents usually show a higher activity. The lowest predation rates appeared in the years and forest sites where the estimated seed production - and consequently the natural resource availability - was higher, thus supporting the predator satiation hypothesis. The use of fences to exclude large herbivores did not significantly decrease the probability of acorn predation. Moreover, in microhabitats located under dense shrubs, losses of acorns were higher inside fenced plots than outside, probably as an indirect consequence of an increase in rodent populations. Based on the results obtained in this study, we discuss the consequences of seed predation on the natural regeneration of oaks and make some practical recommendations for assisted regeneration in oak restoration plans. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Mammalian herbivory can have profound impacts on plant population and communit dynamics However, our understanding of specific herbivore effects remains limited, even in regions wit high densities of domestic and wild herbivores, such as the semiarid conifer forests of western Nort America. We conducted a seven-yea manipulative experiment to evaluate the effects of herbivory b two common ungulates, Cervus elaphus (Rocky Mountain elk) and cattle Bos taurus (domestic cattle) o growth and survival of two woody deciduous species, Populus trichocarpa (cottonwood) and Salix scoulerian (Scouler's willow) in postfire early-successiona forest stands. Additionally, we monitored belowgroun herbivory by Thomomys talpoides (pocket gopher) and explored effects of both aboveground an belowground herbivory on plant vital rates. Three, approximately 7 ha exclosures were constructed, an each was divided into 1-h plots. Seven herbivory treatments were then randomly assigned to the plots three levels of herbivory (low, moderate, and high) for both cattle and elk, and one complete ungulat exclusion treatment. Treatments were implemented for seven years. Results showed that cattle and el substantially reduced height and growth of both cottonwood and willow. Elk had a larger effect on growt and subsequent plant height than cattle, especially for cottonwood, and elk effects occurred even at lo herbivore densities. Pocket gophers had a strong effect on survival of both plant species while herbivor by ungulates did not. However, we documented significant interaction effects of aboveground and belowgroun herbivory on survival. Our study is one of the first to evaluate top-dow regulation by multipl herbivore species at varying densities. Results suggest that traditional exclosure studies that treat herbivor as a binary factor (either present or absent) may not be sufficient to characterize top-dow regulation o plant demography. Rather, the strength of top-dow regulation varies depending on a number of factor including herbivore species, herbivore density, interactions among multiple herbivore species, and varyin tolerance levels of different plant species to herbivory.

   abstract = {In many forested ecosystems, the architecture and functional ecology of certain tree species define forest structure and their species-specific traits control ecosystem dynamics. Such foundation tree species are declining throughout the world due to introductions and outbreaks of pests and pathogens, selective removal of individual taxa, and over-harvesting. Through a series of case studies, we show that the loss of foundation tree species changes the local environment on which a variety of other species depend; how this disrupts fundamental ecosystem processes, including rates of decomposition, nutrient fluxes, carbon sequestration, and energy flow; and dramatically alters the dynamics of associated aquatic ecosystems. Forests in which dynamics are controlled by one or a few foundation species appear to be dominated by a small number of strong interactions and may be highly susceptible to alternating between stable states following even small perturbations. The ongoing decline of many foundation species provides a set of important, albeit unfortunate, opportunities to develop the research tools, models, and metrics needed to identify foundation species, anticipate the cascade of immediate, short- and long-term changes in ecosystem structure and function that will follow from their loss, and provide options for remedial conservation and management. © The Ecological Society of America.},

We determined the de- gree to which a conifer, Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), compensates for biomass losses. By systematically clipping current annual shoots at four different intensities during three consecutive years we simulated winter browsing by moose (Alces alces). To assess the impact of between-tree competition on compensatory growth, clipping was performed at two different tree densities. In terms of current annual shoot growth, individual pines did not overcompensate in response to clipping in any of the treat- ments, although a tendency towards overcompensation was observed at low clipping intensities under crowded conditions. Densely-grown pines compensated for lost biomass more frequently than open-grown pines. Regrowth was delayed the year after intense clipping, suggesting that under natural conditions trees are temporarily released from herbivory. The compensatory growth response was not qualitatively different from that observed in sympatric, early successional deciduous Betula spp. It is suggested that compensatory growth may be a plastic trait in slow-growing conif- erous woody plants. Although pines under specific conditions tended to show over- compensation, we do not consider it a specific adaptation to herbivory.},

   abstract = {Across the northern hemisphere, land use changes and, possibly, warmer winters are leading to more abundant and diverse ungulate communities causing increased socioeconomic and ecological consequences. Reliable population estimates are crucial for sustainable management, but it is currently unclear which monitoring method is most suitable to track changes in multi-species assemblages. We compared dung counts and camera trapping as two non-invasive census methods to estimate population densities of moose Alces alces and roe deer Capreolus capreolus in Northern Sweden. For camera trapping, we tested the random encounter model (REM) which can estimate densities without the need to recognize individual animals. We evaluated different simplification options of the REM in terms of estimates of detection distance and angle (raw data vs. modelled) and of daily movement rate (camera trap based vs. telemetry based). In comparison to density estimates from camera traps, we found that, dung counts appeared to underestimate population density for roe deer, but not for moose. Estimates of detection distance and angle from modelled versus raw camera data resulted in nearly identical outcomes. The telemetry-derived daily movement rate for moose and roe deer resulted in much higher density estimates than the camera trap-derived estimates. We suggest that camera trapping may be a robust complement to dung counts when monitoring ungulate communities, particularly when similarities between dung pellets from sympatric deer species make unambiguous assignment difficult. Moreover, we show that a simplified use of the REM method holds great potential for large-scale citizen science-based programmes (e.g. involving hunters) that can track the rapidly changing European wildlife landscape. We suggest to include camera trapping in management programmes, where the analysis can be verified via web-based applications.},

   abstract = {Ungulate densities and browsing in many European forests have increased over the past several decades. However, the extent to which tree regeneration is influenced by leader shoot browsing by ungulates versus other factors, such as light availability and the edaphic properties of different forest types, is unclear. In this study, tree regeneration in response to ungulate browsing and environmental factors was compared in 49 forest areas in Switzerland. The forests were located 500–1400 m a.s.l. and were characterized by a wide range of soil humidities and acidities. Seedlings of the six most frequent Swiss tree species were repeatedly assessed for leader browsing in 1704 permanently marked sampling plots for at least 10 years. Browsing probabilities and seedling outgrowth (ratio between tree seedlings in the tallest and smallest height classes (hc4: 100–130 cm and hc1: 10–40 cm tree height, respectively) were first estimated in a stratum-specific manner (per forest, plot, species and, for the browsing probability, height class as well) based on GLMMs. Random forest models were then used to separately explain seedling density, outgrowth probability, the temporal development of outgrowth and the species composition based on the estimated browsing probabilities and environmental factors. Browsing probability was among the most important variables explaining species composition, but its contribution to explaining seedling density and outgrowth probability was less than that of other variables, such as stand basal area. The densities of all species declined dramatically when annual browsing exceeded a threshold of ca. 5–10%, but there was very little change above this threshold. Forest type and gap size did not influence the relationship between browsing and seedling density, but a considerably larger number of browsed seedlings was found in closed beech forests than in other forests. Tree species palatability was not related to the proportions of seedlings of different size classes, since for Fagus and Fraxinus more tall than small seedlings were present, while the reverse was observed for Abies, Acer, Sorbus and Picea. The pattern identified in this study can be attributed to the coincidence of environments equally favorable to tree regeneration and ungulates in some but not in other forests. In rare cases, such as after a major disturbance, almost no ungulates were present and tree regeneration was abundant, or vice versa. While browsing intensity seemed to correlate with ungulate density, its impact on seedling density and development may be more complex. Further research is therefore needed to correctly estimate the impact of ungulate browsing on tree regeneration in different forest types},

   abstract = {Because of its biological origin, the wood properties are highly variable and therefore its characterisation is sometimes complex. An improved knowledge of the rheological properties and more particularly of the viscoelastic properties is needed for the development and the optimisation of wood processing and manufacturing based on wooden materials. The main purpose of this work is to characterise the time-dependent behaviour of green wood in water content and temperature-controlled conditions. An experimental device, perfectly adapted to the wood specificity and particularly to its anisotropy and hygroscopicity, was developed. This apparatus, the WAVET (Environmental Vibration Analyser for Wood), permits the determination of the viscoelastic properties of wood using harmonic tests in single cantilever bending for frequencies varying between 5.10-3 Hz and 10 Hz. Conceived to work up to about 5 bars, it allows tests in dry or water-saturated conditions to be performed over a temperature range from 0C to 140C. The results collected for several temperate species using the WAVET emphasise the influence of numerous parameters on the rheological properties and notably on the softening temperature, namely specie, material direction, wood type (normal/reaction) and anatomical and macromolecular structure. The study of the thermal degradation of green wood reveals noticeable modifications in the biochemical composition of this biopolymer. The elastic and damping properties of thermally-treated wood in water-saturated conditions change a lot according to the severity of the treatment and the native structure of the constitutive macromolecules.},

   abstract = {Population sizes and species distributions of wild ungulates in Europe have increased during the past decades, and continue to do so. As a result, browsing pressure in forests is increasing and concerns about the effects of increasingly common multi-species deer communities on forestry are rising. However, we currently lack an understanding of how the composition of deer communities affects browsing damage, particularly with respect to the role of species with different dietary requirements. Further, the relative importance of predictors of browsing damage in systems with multiple browsers remains elusive. Here, we used data from Swedish management, which is monitoring ungulates and their damage to forests, to test how deer densities, forage availability, and winter severity predict browsing damage on commercially important Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) at national and regional scales. Moose (Alces alces) is the main browser of Scots pine, but competes with other deer over more preferred forage. During winter, a higher index of moose density was associated with higher browsing damage in northern Sweden, where there is low competition from other deer. In southern Sweden, competition from other deer is higher and a higher density index of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) was associated with higher winter damage. However, there was no relationship between moose density and damage. We suggest that moose are forced to browse more pine due to interspecific competition over alternative forage resources in the south, yielding stronger relationships between densities of competing deer species and damage than between moose density and damage. Pine density, a proxy for forage availability, was an equally or more important determinant for browsing damage as deer density indices in most regions. Increasing pine density was associated with reduced browsing damage caused in winter in all regions and reduced damage caused in summer in central Sweden. Increased winter severity, as an index of snow depth, predicted increased winter damage in the northern region only. To reduce winter damage, our results suggest that management should consider deer densities and forage availability simultaneously, while adopting a multi-species approach. Results varied among regions, with densities of other deer being more relevant in the south and winter severity more relevant in the north. Management data did not predict summer damage well. Since national models did not capture regional variations, we conclude that management decisions and actions need to be tailored to the regional or local scale.},

   abstract = {Browsing of tree saplings by deer hampers forest regeneration in mixed forests across Europe and North America. It is well known that tree species are differentially affected by deer browsing, but little is known about how different facets of diversity, such as species richness, identity, and composition, affect browsing intensity at different spatial scales. Using forest inventory data from the Hainich National Park, a mixed deciduous forest in central Germany, we applied a hierarchical approach to model the browsing probability of patches (regional scale) as well as the species-specific proportion of saplings browsed within patches (patch scale). We found that, at the regional scale, the probability that a patch was browsed increased with certain species composition, namely with low abundance of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and high abundance of European ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), whereas at the patch scale, the proportion of saplings browsed per species was mainly determined by the species’ identity, providing a “preference ranking” of the 11 tree species under study. Interestingly, at the regional scale, species-rich patches were more likely to be browsed; however, at the patch scale, species-rich patches showed a lower proportion of saplings per species browsed. Presumably, diverse patches attract deer, but satisfy nutritional needs faster, such that fewer saplings need to be browsed. Some forest stand parameters, such as more open canopies, increased the browsing intensity at either scale. By showing the effects that various facets of diversity, as well as environmental parameters, exerted on browsing intensity at the regional as well as patch scale, our study advances the understanding of mammalian herbivore–plant interactions across scales. Our results also indicate which regeneration patches and species are (least) prone to browsing and show the importance of different facets of diversity for the prediction and management of browsing intensity and regeneration dynamics.},

   abstract = {Predicting the diet of large mammalian herbivores is difficult due to the many factors at multiple scales that influence diet selection. One approach to understanding diet selection is to relate diet choices to the foliar and structural traits of forage species. Using data on diet selection by red deer (Cervus elaphus scoticus) in Fiordland National Park, New Zealand, we determined the extent to which interspecific differences in the palatability of 46 plant species could be explained by 11 chemical and structural characteristics of plant foliage. Woody species were more palatable to deer than non-woody species (mostly ferns) and palatability declined with increasing concentrations of foliar cellulose. High concentrations of cellulose in fern leaves may increase toughness and resistance to tearing by herbivores, thus contributing to the low palatability of these plants. When two species that were consumed only in the winter were removed from the analysis, palatability was also negatively correlated with phenolic content. High phenolic concentrations may deter herbivory in summer, when forage with low phenolic concentrations is available (e.g. herbaceous dicots), whereas deer may have little choice but to consume species rich in phenolics during winter, when less forage is available. The relatively high concentrations of phenolics in our dataset compared to other floras, despite the absence of large native mammalian herbivores in New Zealand, suggest that these compounds are multifunctional.},

   abstract = {As plants develop from seeds to seedlings, juveniles and mature stages, their ontogeny can constrain the expression of resistance to herbivore damage. Nevertheless, ecological and evolutionary theories regarding interactions between plants, herbivores and their natural enemies are largely based on observations and experiments conducted at a single ontogenetic stage. Owing to resource allocation and architectural constraints in plants, and the influence of herbivore foraging behavior, resistance to herbivores is likely to change during plant development. We propose that such changes are likely to occur in a non-linear fashion and suggest that the role of ontogeny should be incorporated as an important factor in new syntheses of plant defense theory. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Forests are critical for the world's biodiversity, the regulation of the Earth's climate, and the provision of goods and services for humans. This review focuses on four broad topics: (1) key processes threatening forest biodiversity; (2) broad strategies for mitigating threatening processes; (3) climate change and forest biodiversity; and, (4) plantations and biodiversity. How key issues within these broad topics are addressed will have profound effects on forest biodiversity and the Earth's climate. A significant global problem for biodiversity conservation is the conversion of natural forests to other land uses, both in developing and developed nations; ways must be urgently identified to halt forest conversion. When forests are logged for timber or pulpwood and then regenerated, impacts on biodiversity are harder to quantify than when forests are converted to other land uses. Hence, the effectiveness of efforts to mitigate such impacts (where they occur) is frequently not well known. Climate change may result in substantial changes to forest ecosystems, and its effects may interact in additive or cumulative ways with other human disturbances in forests, although work on such combinations of impacts is in its infancy. The establishment of plantations of trees is frequently proposed to sequester large amounts of carbon andor produce biofuels to mitigate the climate-change effects. However, there is potential for perverse outcomes, such as biodiversity loss where plantation establishment is narrowly focused and other environmental values are ignored. © 2009 New York Academy of Sciences.},

The economic capture approach is promoted by international organizations such as the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) through Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD), Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) and The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB). This paper will inquire as to how forest protection is related to issues of social and ecological justice, exploring whether forest exploitation based on the top-down managerial model fosters an unequitable distribution of resources. Both top-down and community-based approaches to forest protection will be critically examined and a more inclusive ethical framework to forest protection will be offered. The findings of this examination indicate the need for a renewed focus on existing examples of good practice in addressing both social and ecological need, as well as the necessity to address the less comfortable problem of where compromise appears less possible. The conclusion argues for the need to consider ecological justice as an important aspect of more socially orientated environmental justice for forest protection.},

   abstract = {Human-driven land-use changes increasingly threaten biodiversity, particularly in tropical forests where both species diversity and human pressures on natural environments are high. The rapid conversion of tropical forests for agriculture, timber production and other uses has generated vast, human-dominated landscapes with potentially dire consequences for tropical biodiversity. Today, few truly undisturbed tropical forests exist, whereas those degraded by repeated logging and fires, as well as secondary and plantation forests, are rapidly expanding. Here we provide a global assessment of the impact of disturbance and land conversion on biodiversity in tropical forests using a meta-analysis of 138 studies. We analysed 2,220 pairwise comparisons of biodiversity values in primary forests (with little or no human disturbance) and disturbed forests. We found that biodiversity values were substantially lower in degraded forests, but that this varied considerably by geographic region, taxonomic group, ecological metric and disturbance type. Even after partly accounting for confounding colonization and succession effects due to the composition of surrounding habitats, isolation and time since disturbance, we find that most forms of forest degradation have an overwhelmingly detrimental effect on tropical biodiversity. Our results clearly indicate that when it comes to maintaining tropical biodiversity, there is no substitute for primary forests. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {We explore population trends of widespread and common woodland birds using data from an extensive European network of ornithologists for the period 1980-2003. We show considerable differences exist in the European trends of species according to the broad habitat they occupy and the degree to which they specialize in habitat use. On average, common forest birds are in shallow decline at a European scale; common forest birds declined by 13%, and common forest specialists by 18%, from 1980 to 2003. In comparison, populations of common specialists of farmland have declined moderately, falling on average by 28% from 1980 to 2003. These patterns contrast with that shown by generalist species whose populations have been roughly stable over the same period, their overall index increasing by 3%. There was some evidence of regional variation in the population trends of these common forest species. The most obvious pattern was the greater stability of population trends in Eastern Europe compared with other regions considered. Among common forest birds, long-distance migrants and residents have on average declined most strongly, whereas short-distance migrants have been largely stable, or have increased. There was some evidence to suggest that ground- or low-nesting species have declined more strongly on average, as have forest birds with invertebrate diets. Formal analysis of the species trends confirmed the influence of habitat use, habitat specialization and nest-site; the effects of region and migration strategy were less clear-cut. There was also evidence to show that year-to-year variation in individual species trends at a European scale was influenced by cold winter weather in a small number of species. We recommend that the species trend information provided by the new pan-European scheme should be used alongside existing mechanisms to review the conservation status of European birds. The analysis also allows us to reappraise the role of common forest bird populations as a potential barometer of wider forest health. The new indicator appears to be a useful indicator of the state of widespread European forest birds and might prove to be a useful surrogate for trends in forest biodiversity and forest health, but more work is likely to be needed to understand the interaction between bird populations and their drivers in forest. © 2007 The Authors.},

   abstract = {Disturbance regimes are changing in forests across the world in response to global climate change. Despite the profound impacts of disturbances on ecosystem services and biodiversity, assessments of disturbances at the global scale remain scarce. Here, we analyzed natural disturbances in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems for the period 2001–2014, aiming to 1) quantify their within- and between-biome variation and 2) compare the climate sensitivity of disturbances across biomes. We studied 103 unmanaged forest landscapes with a total land area of 28.2 × 106 ha, distributed across five continents. A consistent and comprehensive quantification of disturbances was derived by combining satellite-based disturbance maps with local expert knowledge of disturbance agents. We used Gaussian finite mixture models to identify clusters of landscapes with similar disturbance activity as indicated by the percent forest area disturbed as well as the size, edge density and perimeter–area-ratio of disturbed patches. The climate sensitivity of disturbances was analyzed using Bayesian generalized linear mixed effect models and a globally consistent climate dataset. Within-biome variation in natural disturbances was high in both boreal and temperate biomes, and disturbance patterns did not vary systematically with latitude or biome. The emergent clusters of disturbance activity in the boreal zone were similar to those in the temperate zone, but boreal landscapes were more likely to experience high disturbance activity than their temperate counterparts. Across both biomes high disturbance activity was particularly associated with wildfire, and was consistently linked to years with warmer and drier than average conditions. Natural disturbances are a key driver of variability in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems, with high similarity in the disturbance patterns between both biomes. The universally high climate sensitivity of disturbances across boreal and temperate ecosystems indicates that future climate change could substantially increase disturbance activity.},

   abstract = {Given the substantial contributions of forest biodiversity and ecosystem services to society, forest sciences have a large potential to contribute to the integrity and sustainability of our future. This is especially true when the roles of biodiversity for sustaining ecosystem services are considered. The rapid expansion of sustainable forest management (SFM) has resulted in the adoption of various forest management frameworks intended to safeguard biodiversity. Concurrently, the importance of forest ecosystem services has been increasingly recognized. Although some initiatives aimed at conserving both biodiversity and ecosystem services are emerging, knowledge gaps still exist about their relationships and potential trade-offs in forests. Given recent advancements, increasing opportunities and some lags in forest ecology, further research on biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services will play substantial roles in the development of SFM practices. Here, we identified key issues including (i) relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem function as a foundation of ecological integrity, (ii) resilience thinking to better prepare for and adapt to environmental changes, (iii) social–ecological perspectives that facilitate real-world conservation and management and (iv) theory-driven restoration that bridges science and practice. Thus, we illustrate priorities and future possibilities in applied ecology studies in forests, which will help society and ecosystems to build capacity and resilience to face uncertainty in the changing environment. Synthesis and applications. Under substantial human influences, forests are highly likely to be largely altered, potentially leading to the emergence of novel ecosystems or alternative stable states. Management thus needs more flexible, novel measures to address the significant uncertainty this generates. Resilience-based approaches are important to respond adaptively to future changes and cope with surprises, potentially providing multiple options. Although challenges exist, theory should play an important role in managing, conserving and restoring forest ecosystems. The issues discussed here should receive further attention in the context of the multiple goals of sustainable forest management.},

We also consider relationships between forest biodiversity and multifunctionality, and trade-offs among ecosystem services. We compare the concepts of ecosystem processes, functions and services to clarify their definitions. Our review of published studies indicates a lack of empirical studies that establish quantitative and causal relationships between forest biodiversity and many important ecosystem services. The literature is highly skewed; studies on provisioning of nutrition and energy, and on cultural services, delivered by mixed-species forests are under-represented. Planted forests offer ample opportunity for optimising their composition and diversity because replanting after harvesting is a recurring process. Planting mixed-species forests should be given more consideration as they are likely to provide a wider range of ecosystem services within the forest and for adjacent land uses.

This paper considers the role of natural processes in creating clearings and the role of inadvertent impact of human activity on forest processes, including woodland regeneration. The role of climate, wind-throw and lightning strikes in creating clearings and forest instability is emphasised and the evidence discussed from sites which may be interpreted as resulting from opportunistic human use of natural clearings. Unfortunately, regional pollen diagrams lack sufficient spatial resolution to detect the size of isolated clearings or establish the spatial variation In forest composition that was intimately related both to forest ecology and the effects of subtle human impacts. This may be the major reason for an apparent contradiction between pollen evidence of Neolithic impact and the archaeological record. Moreover, early Neolithic agricultural activity may have been concentrated in valley bottoms, which is undetectable in regional pollen diagrams. Alternative models need to be considered, which include culturally specific exploitation of the local environment, along with the inadvertent ecological repercussions of pre-agricultural and early-agricultural human activities in naturally dynamic woodlands.},

   abstract = {Forest soils can suffer from various threats, some of which are human induced. Although mechanized harvesting allows for high productivity, it may also seriously damage forest soils. In recent decades, the use of powerful and heavy machinery in forest management has increased exponentially. The extent, degree, and duration of direct and indirect effects of heavy traffic on soils depend on several factors, such as soil texture, moisture, and organic matter content, slope of the terrain, type and size of vehicles, wheel inflation pressure, tire shape, and number of vehicles trips. Topsoil compaction and the alteration of ground morphology are crucial direct effects of forest harvesting carried out using heavy equipment. Soil compaction results in reduced porosity, which implies limitations in oxygen and water supply to soil microorganisms and plants, with negative consequences for soil ecology and forest productivity. Compaction, especially when confined in ruts, also has dramatic ramifications in terms of runoff and erosion of the most fertile soil compartment (i.e., the top soil). In compacted soils, forest regeneration can be impeded or even prevented for long time periods. A detailed review of the abundant although still insufficient literature on machinery-induced negative effects on forest soils and their ramifications for forest ecology and management is provided here, along with recommendations for best practices to limit such damage.},

   abstract = {We investigated patterns, rates, and mechanisms of forest replacement by salt marsh in relation to sea-level rise on the west coast of Florida, USA. The geomorphology of this region typifies that of low-lying, limestone coastlines considered highly susceptible to sea-level rise (e.g., much of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the Yucatan Peninsula, and low-lying limestone islands throughout the world). This coast is microtidal, shallowly sloping, and has a rate of relative sea-level rise similar to that of eustatic rise. To determine patterns of forest change in relation to sea-level rise, we examined patterns of tree species zonation, tree recruitment, and tree mortality in relation to site elevation and tidal-flooding frequency. To reconstruct histories of forest change in relation to sea-level rise, we estimated age distributions of Sabal palmetto, the most widely distributed tree species at our site, relating age structures of stands to reconstructed histories of tidal flooding in the stands. Finally, to assess the relative roles of flooding stress (hypoxia), salt exposure, and competition from encroaching salt-marsh vegetation in the decline of forest stands, we examined patterns of soil redox potential, groundwater salinity, and density of halophytic vegetation among stands in different stages of decline. Zonation among tree species was related to tidal-flooding frequency. For most trees, seedlings were absent from the most frequently flooded stands in which the species occurred. Reconstructed flooding histories of stands and age estimates for S. palmetto suggest that many decades elapse between cessation of regeneration and local elimination of a tree species. Even during the relatively short duration of the study (4 yr), however, composition of some stands changed in the direction predicted from species zonation and sea-level rise. Forest understory replacement by halophytic vegetation appeared to follow, rather than cause, failure of tree regeneration. Tidal flooding rarely produced severe reducing conditions in soil, but groundwater salinity was correlated with tidal-flooding frequency. Forest retreat in this system, therefore, involves the development of relict (non-regenerating) stands of different tree species at different flooding frequencies. Exposure to salt appears to be the major cause of tree regeneration failure, with flooding stress and interference from marsh vegetation playing minor or negligible roles. These interactions differ somewhat from those on deltaic coasts or coasts with high freshwater outflows, where flooding stress may play a larger role in regeneration failure, and from sandy coasts, where erosion may play a larger role in forest retreat. Regardless of the cause of tree regeneration failure, the development of relict stands may be a general forest response to sea-level rise.},

   abstract = {Drought events are increasing globally, and reports of consequent forest mortality are widespread. However, due to a lack of a quantitative global synthesis, it is still not clear whether drought-induced mortality rates differ among global biomes and whether functional traits influence the risk of drought-induced mortality. To address these uncertainties, we performed a global meta-analysis of 58 studies of drought-induced forest mortality. Mortality rates were modelled as a function of drought, temperature, biomes, phylogenetic and functional groups and functional traits. We identified a consistent global-scale response, where mortality increased with drought severity [log mortality (trees trees−1 year−1) increased 0.46 (95% CI = 0.2–0.7) with one SPEI unit drought intensity]. We found no significant differences in the magnitude of the response depending on forest biomes or between angiosperms and gymnosperms or evergreen and deciduous tree species. Functional traits explained some of the variation in drought responses between species (i.e. increased from 30 to 37% when wood density and specific leaf area were included). Tree species with denser wood and lower specific leaf area showed lower mortality responses. Our results illustrate the value of functional traits for understanding patterns of drought-induced tree mortality and suggest that mortality could become increasingly widespread in the future.},

While vertebrate defaunation is of growing policy concern, the effects of vertebrate loss on natural forest regeneration have yet to be quantified globally.

We demonstrate that real-world defaunation caused by hunting and habitat fragmentation leads to reduced forest regeneration, although manipulation experiments provide contrasting findings. The extirpation of primates and birds cause the greatest declines in forest regeneration, emphasising their key role in maintaining carbon stores, and the need for national and international climate change and conservation strategies to protect forests from defaunation fronts as well as deforestation fronts.},

Yet, the way that climate change may alter regeneration is unclear. We developed a quantitative framework that estimates forest regeneration potential (RP) as a function of key environmental conditions for ponderosa pine, a key dryland forest species. We integrated meteorological data and climate projections for 47 ponderosa pine forest sites across the western United States, and evaluated RP using an ecosystem water balance model. Our primary goal was to contrast conditions supporting regeneration among historical, mid-21st century and late-21st century time frames. Future climatic conditions supported 50% higher RP in 2020–2059 relative to 1910–2014. As temperatures increased more substantially in 2060–2099, seedling survival decreased, RP declined by 50%, and the frequency of years with very low RP increased from 25% to 58%. Thus, climate change may initially support higher RP and increase the likelihood of successful regeneration events, yet will ultimately reduce average RP and the frequency of years with moderate climate support of regeneration. Our results suggest that climate change alone may begin to restrict the persistence and expansion of dryland forests by limiting seedling survival in the late 21st century.},

We use modeled climate projections to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to observed increases in eight fuel aridity metrics and forest fire area across the western United States. Anthropogenic increases in temperature and vapor pressure deficit significantly enhanced fuel aridity across western US forests over the past several decades and, during 2000-2015, contributed to 75% more forested area experiencing high (>1 σ) fire-season fuel aridity and an average of nine additional days per year of high fire potential. Anthropogenic climate change accounted for ∼55% of observed increases in fuel aridity from 1979 to 2015 across western US forests, highlighting both anthropogenic climate change and natural climate variability as important contributors to increased wildfire potential in recent decades. We estimate that human-caused climate change contributed to an additional 4.2 million ha of forest fire area during 1984-2015, nearly doubling the forest fire area expected in its absence. Natural climate variability will continue to alternate between modulating and compounding anthropogenic increases in fuel aridity, but anthropogenic climate change has emerged as a driver of increased forest fire activity and should continue to do so while fuels are not limiting.},

   abstract = {Natural disturbances like wildfire, windthrow and insect outbreaks are critical drivers of composition, structure and functioning of forest ecosystems. They are strongly climate-sensitive, and are thus likely to be distinctly affected by climatic changes. Observations across Europe show that in recent decades, forest disturbance regimes have intensified markedly, resulting in a strong increase in damage from wind, bark beetles and wildfires. Climate change is frequently hypothesized as the main driving force behind this intensification, but changes in forest structure and composition associated with management activities such as promoting conifers and increasing standing timber volume (i.e. 'forest change') also strongly influence susceptibility to disturbances. Here, we show that from 1958 to 2001, forest change contributed in the same order of magnitude as climate change to the increase in disturbance damage in Europe's forests. Climate change was the main driver of the increase in area burnt, while changes in forest extent, structure and composition particularly affected the variation in wind and bark beetle damage. For all three disturbance agents, damage was most severe when conducive weather conditions and increased forest susceptibility coincided. We conclude that a continuing trend towards more disturbance-prone conditions is likely for large parts of Europe's forests, and can have strong detrimental effects on forest carbon storage and other ecosystem services. Understanding the interacting drivers of natural disturbance regimes is thus a prerequisite for climate change mitigation and adaptation in forest ecosystem management. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions have significantly altered global climate, and will continue to do so in the future. Increases in the frequency, duration, and/or severity of drought and heat stress associated with climate change could fundamentally alter the composition, structure, and biogeography of forests in many regions. Of particular concern are potential increases in tree mortality associated with climate-induced physiological stress and interactions with other climate-mediated processes such as insect outbreaks and wildfire. Despite this risk, existing projections of tree mortality are based on models that lack functionally realistic mortality mechanisms, and there has been no attempt to track observations of climate-driven tree mortality globally. Here we present the first global assessment of recent tree mortality attributed to drought and heat stress. Although episodic mortality occurs in the absence of climate change, studies compiled here suggest that at least some of the world's forested ecosystems already may be responding to climate change and raise concern that forests may become increasingly vulnerable to higher background tree mortality rates and die-off in response to future warming and drought, even in environments that are not normally considered water-limited. This further suggests risks to ecosystem services, including the loss of sequestered forest carbon and associated atmospheric feedbacks. Our review also identifies key information gaps and scientific uncertainties that currently hinder our ability to predict tree mortality in response to climate change and emphasizes the need for a globally coordinated observation system. Overall, our review reveals the potential for amplified tree mortality due to drought and heat in forests worldwide.},

We show a persistent and widespread increase of growing season integrated LAI (greening) over 25% to 50% of the global vegetated area, whereas less than 4% of the globe shows decreasing LAI (browning). Factorial simulations with multiple global ecosystem models suggest that CO2 fertilization effects explain 70% of the observed greening trend, followed by nitrogen deposition (9%), climate change (8%) and land cover change (LCC) (4%). CO2 fertilization effects explain most of the greening trends in the tropics, whereas climate change resulted in greening of the high latitudes and the Tibetan Plateau. LCC contributed most to the regional greening observed in southeast China and the eastern United States. The regional effects of unexplained factors suggest that the next generation of ecosystem models will need to explore the impacts of forest demography, differences in regional management intensities for cropland and pastures, and other emerging productivity constraints such as phosphorus availability.},

   abstract = {Key message: Adaptation of forest management to climate change requires an understanding of the effects of climate on forests, industries and communities; prediction of how these effects might change over time; and incorporation of this knowledge into management decisions. This requires multiple forms of knowledge and new approaches to forest management decisions. Partnerships that integrate researchers from multiple disciplines with forest managers and local actors can build a shared understanding of future challenges and facilitate improved decision making in the face of climate change.Context: Climate change presents significant potential risks to forests and challenges for forest managers. Adaptation to climate change involves monitoring and anticipating change and undertaking actions to avoid the negative consequences and to take advantage of potential benefits of those changes.Aims: This paper aimed to review recent research on climate change impacts and management options for adaptation to climate change and to identify key themes for researchers and for forest managers.Methods: The study is based on a review of literature on climate change impacts on forests and adaptation options for forest management identified in the Web of Science database, focusing on papers and reports published between 1945 and 2013.Results: One thousand one hundred seventy-two papers were identified in the search, with the vast majority of papers published from 1986 to 2013. Seventy-six percent of papers involved assessment of climate change impacts or the sensitivity or vulnerability of forests to climate change and 11 % (130) considered adaptation. Important themes from the analysis included (i) predicting species and ecosystem responses to future climate, (ii) adaptation actions in forest management, (iii) new approaches and tools for decision making under uncertainty and stronger partnerships between researchers and practitioners and (iv) policy arrangements for adaptation in forest management.Conclusions: Research to support adaptation to climate change is still heavily focused on assessing impacts and vulnerability. However, more refined impact assessments are not necessarily leading to better management decisions. Multi-disciplinary research approaches are emerging that integrate traditional forest ecosystem sciences with social, economic and behavioural sciences to improve decision making. Implementing adaptation options is best achieved by building a shared understanding of future challenges among different institutions, agencies, forest owners and stakeholders. Research-policy-practice partnerships that recognise local management needs and indigenous knowledge and integrate these with climate and ecosystem science can facilitate improved decision making.},

   abstract = {Shifting disturbance regimes can have cascading effects on many ecosystems processes. This is particularly true when the scale of the disturbance no longer matches the regeneration strategy of the dominant vegetation. In the yellow pine and mixed conifer forests of California, over a century of fire exclusion and the warming climate are increasing the incidence and extent of stand-replacing wildfire; such changes in severity patterns are altering regeneration dynamics by dramatically increasing the distance from live tree seed sources. This has raised concerns about limitations to natural reforestation and the potential for conversion to non-forested vegetation types, which in turn has implications for shifts in many ecological processes and ecosystem services. We used a California region-wide data set with 1,848 plots across 24 wildfires in yellow pine and mixed conifer forests to build a spatially explicit habitat suitability model for forecasting postfire forest regeneration. To model the effect of seed availability, the critical initial biological filter for regeneration, we used a novel approach to predicting spatial patterns of seed availability by estimating annual seed production from existing basal area and burn severity maps. The probability of observing any conifer seedling in a 60-m2 area (the field plot scale) was highly dependent on 30-yr average annual precipitation, burn severity, and seed availability. We then used this model to predict regeneration probabilities across the entire extent of a “new” fire (the 2014 King Fire), which highlights the spatial variability inherent in postfire regeneration patterns. Such forecasts of postfire regeneration patterns are of importance to land managers and conservationists interested in maintaining forest cover on the landscape. Our tool can also help anticipate shifts in ecosystem properties, supporting researchers interested in investigating questions surrounding alternative stable states, and the interaction of altered disturbance regimes and the changing climate.},

In this study, we compare methods to compute multispecies supranational indices and explore different approaches to trend and error estimation, the presentation of indices, and species selection. We do so using population trend data on forest and farmland birds from 28 European countries, 1980–2015. 3. We find relative stability in common European forest bird populations over this period, but a severe decline in farmland bird populations. Altering the benchmark year affects index characteristics and ease of interpretation. We show that using annual species’ indices and their SEs to calculate confidence intervals delivers greater precision in index estimates than bootstrapping across species. The inclusion of individual species within indices has limited leverage on index characteristics, but subjective selection of species based on specialisation has the potential to generate bias. 4. Multispecies indices are valuable policy-relevant tools for describing biodiversity health. Their calculation and presentation need to be tailored to meet specific policy objectives, and they must be supported by clear interpretative information. We recommend methods for indicator analysis, forms of presentation, and the adoption of an objective species selection protocol to ensure indicators are representative and sensitive to environmental change.},

   abstract = {Changes in forestry practices and on-going climate change may both have large impacts on forest bird populations. However, large-scale analyses of the effects of temporal changes in forest structure on forest bird numbers are largely lacking. We compared temporal trends from two Swedish nationwide long-term monitoring schemes, the Swedish Bird Survey (1998–2015) and the Swedish National Forestry Inventory (1983–2014), giving representative values for both forest and bird changes over an area of 35 million ha. Since 1998 the total area of middle-aged and mature forest increased by 6.4%. In parallel, several forest structures potentially beneficial to birds (dead wood, retention trees on clear cuts, multi-layer forests, old forest and broadleaved forest) increased somewhat in abundance, most likely as a result of legislation changes and increasing areas under forest certification schemes. Summer temperatures also increased, with warm summers dominating since 2002. In 1998–2015, the population sizes of 58 forest bird species on average increased, as did the number of species observed per route, with no general difference between forest specialists (16 species) and generalists (42 species). However, from around 2005, the positive trends in bird numbers and many forest structures have levelled out. An analysis of species population trends in relation to a measure of climate sensitivity (Species Temperature Index, STI) suggested that forest birds, just like Swedish birds in general, have indeed been affected by a warming climate. But given their STI, forest birds on average had more positive trends than non-forest birds, suggesting that other factors than climate have affected them positively. Strong candidate factors are the documented changes in forest quality and quantity. Whereas our data and analyses are correlational, and no firm conclusions on causality therefore can be drawn, it is reasonable to assume that the recent increases in forest quantity, forest quality, and summer temperatures, all have contributed to the general increase in forest bird numbers in Sweden. But the relative contribution of these driving forces remains to be determined. When it comes to the potentially positive effects of improving forest quality in terms of increases in old forest, stratification, retention trees and dead wood, it is noteworthy that many of the positive trends in forest structures since the mid-1990s seem to have ceased recently.},

   abstract = {High densities of ungulates can increase human-wildlife conflicts. Where forestry is an important economy, intensive browsing can lead to browsing damage, resulting in volume losses, poor stand regeneration, and reduced timber quality. The forestry industry thus looks for practical, long-term measures to mitigate browsing damage. We tested the effect of two mitigation measures on moose (Alces alces) browsing behaviour and damage to Scots pine (Pinus sylvetris): (1) ungulate-adapted slash piles (i.e., palatable species only) created during felling to increase short-term food availability and (2) intensified soil scarification to increase long-term food availability (collectively, ‘ungulate-adapted forestry’). Our study occurred in southern Norway where we established fixed vegetation and moose faecal pellet plots at varying distances from conventional and ungulate-adapted slash piles and scarified stands. We evaluated the effects of ungulate-adapted slash piles and intensified scarification on the density of undamaged Scots pine, moose bite diameters, browsing pressure, and moose faecal pellet density. To assess the effect of spatial scale, we created 250 m, 500 m, and 1000-m radius buffers centered on each plot. We found that ungulate-adapted logging near our plots increased the density of undamaged pines, as compared to no and conventional logging. We found that logging in general led to smaller bite diameters. We also found that plots near conventional logging had higher browsing pressure, whereas browsing pressure near ungulate-adapted logging was similar to unlogged stands. For scarification, density of undamaged pine increased when the ungulate-adapted stand aged whereas undamaged pine decreased as conventional scarification stands aged. Browsing pressure showed a response at the smallest spatial scale only for ungulate-adapted scarification. Peak moose habitat use near conventional and ungulate-adapted scarified stands differed by stand age and distance from scarification. The overall effects of ungulate-adapted forestry were most pronounced at the smallest spatial scale (250 m). Our results support ‘ungulate-adapted’ forestry as a practical solution to mitigate browsing damage but uncertainty in some of our estimates suggest further research on the area treated is needed.},

   abstract = {Ungulate herbivores modify plant community compositions, which can modulate biodiversity at higher trophic levels. However, these cascading effects on herbivorous and predatory arthropods in forest ecosystems remain poorly understood. We compared plant and arthropod communities between fenced exclosures and unfenced control plots in a permanent forest in Germany. After five years of deer exclusion, we quantified plant diversity and vegetation structure as well as the diversity of insects and spiders in 32 pair-wise plots. In addition, we compared spider communities with respect to different hunting guilds because they are expected to have different requirements for vegetation structure. Although we did not find differences in plant communities, vegetation height and heterogeneity were higher in exclosures compared to control plots. The diversity of insects and spiders was not affected by deer presence. However, the abundance of sheet-web weavers and ambush hunters was lower in exclosures whereas ground hunters were more common in exclosure plots. Structural changes in the vegetation changed predator hunting guilds even though mere abundance and biodiversity indices were not affected. We therefore suggest that monitoring of vegetation structure and associated functional groups seems more sensitive to assess the impact of ungulate herbivores compared to taxonomic metrics.},

   abstract = {Avec l'augmentation des sécheresses dans les forêts tempérées, la gestion sylvicole envisage de réduire la densité des peuplements adultes pour limiter le déficit hydrique. Cependant, la réduction de la canopée arborée augmente le rayonnement dans le sous-bois et permet le développement de la strate herbacée monopoliste. Nos objectifs étaient de caractériser l'évapotranspiration (ETu) de 4 herbacées monopolistes (Molinia caerulea, Calluna vulgaris, Pteridium aquilinum and Rubus sp.) et de quantifier leur impact sur la teneur en eau du sol (SWC) dans des peuplements de Quercus petraea. L’ETu des quatre herbacées cultivées en pot a été quantifiée en conditions semi-contrôlées caractérisées par deux niveaux d’éclairement relatif et 3 niveaux de SWC. In situ, le SWC, le microclimat et l’ETu de P. aquilinum et M. caerulea ont été mesurés sur 20 dispositifs dans les peuplements forestiers de Q. petraea présentant un gradient croissant de LAI. Chaque dispositif était subdivisé en 2 placettes, l’une était désherbée et l'autre enherbée. M. caerulea et C. vulgaris ont une faible régulation de leur ETu alors que P. aquilinum et Rubus sp. ont une stratégie conservatrice face au stress hydrique. SWC diminue plus rapidement quand le LAI de la strate herbacée augmente, ce qui est directement lié à l’ouverture du couvert arboré avec une valeur seuil de LAI de la strate arborée à 2-3, sous laquelle la contribution de la strate herbacée à l’évapotranspiration du peuplement pourrait compenser la diminution de celle de la strate arborée.Ces résultats montrent la nécessité de considérer la végétation du sous-bois dans la gestion sylvicole notamment lorsque la ressource hydrique est limitante. Ainsi, la réduction de la densité de la strate arborée doit être un compromis entre la réduction de la surface foliaire des arbres pour réduire l’ET, et le maintien d’une densité suffisante de la strate arborée pour limiter la croissance et l'ETu de la végétation du sous-bois.},

China has more plantations than any other country as a consequence of massive afforestation efforts. We use data from China to comparatively examine tree biomass and productivity of planted and natural stands in relation to climate zone, latitude, elevation, age and species diversity (richness). Location Six forest climate/vegetation zones in China. Methods We used a database completed in 2007 and then updated in 2013 that contained extensive records of forest stands (10 m × 10 m plots) across China. The database records included a total of 6153 forest stands (1716 planted forests aged 0-80 years and 4437 natural forests of aged 0-400 years), located from 18.1 to 53.2° N and 75.53 to 131.8° E, and between elevations of 7 and 4240 m above sea level. These forests were grouped into six climate zones for comparisons. Results Under generally similar physical conditions (climate zones) to those in natural forests and despite having low diversity (i.e. often a single tree species), plantations aged 0-80 years already had similar biomass but much higher productivity, and thus much higher carbon sequestration rates, than natural forests. Tree biomass, productivity and their above/below ground ratios showed stronger latitudinal and elevational trends in natural forests than in planted forests. No difference in productivity was observed between the planted forests with one or two species; in natural forests, however, high diversity usually led to high productivity. Main conclusions The differences in performance between planted and natural forests were mainly explained by: (1) age (the plantations were in early succession), (2) elevation (plantations were located at lower elevations), and (3) species selection (only highly productive species were planted). As the plantations were all still young, closer monitoring of their performance is needed.},

   abstract = {Accurately predicting the dynamics of tree species productivity as well as their ranges at large scales is of key importance for assessing the impact of global change on forests. Dynamic vegetation models (DVMs), particularly forest gap models (FGMs), have been suggested as suitable tools for such joint predictions. However, DVMs generally feature a large number of parameters that need to be estimated and may cause considerable uncertainty in model outputs. In addition, model sensitivity may depend on environmental conditions, stand composition and development stage. We systematically evaluated the parameter sensitivity on simulated basal area of the state-of-the art FGM ForClim along a wide ecological gradient to analyze model behavior and identify key parameters and processes that cause the highest variability in model output. We applied the revised Morris screening method at 30 representative sites across Europe, and compared results for monospecific and mixed stands at two system states in time, i.e. early and late succession (dynamic equilibrium). The most influential parameters were related to tree establishment, the water and light regimes, growth and temperature, whereby the relative parameter influence of the latter strongly varied with climate. Further, model sensitivity differed between monospecific and mixed stands as well as between early and late succession, reflecting the differential influence of ecological processes with stand structure. We conclude that the parameter sensitivity of complex models should be analyzed individually for several system states of interest. We recommend to focus the further development (process representation and calibration) and analysis of FGMs on process representations related to establishment, water limitations and phenology to improve the robustness of model predictions. We provide recommendations for specific improvements of FGMs to better represent range dynamics.},

From the 1870s to the present, the reforestation of Hong Kong's tree-less hills has been a constant concern of successive governments. The major justification for this policy, however, has shifted: from health and aesthetic reasons in the 19th century, controlling soil erosion and improving water supplies for most of this century, to the current interest in ecological restoration. Despite periodic optimism about potential economic benefits, forestry in Hong Kong has never been commercially viable. A wide range of native and exotic tree species has been tried but less than a dozen have been extensively planted with a high degree of success: the natives Pinus massoniana, Schima superba and Castanopsis fissa, and the exotics Acacia confusa, Lophostemon confertus, Pinus elliottii and four species of Eucalyptus. Pinus massoniana was by far the most important species until its recent virtual elimination by the pine wood nematode. Experience so far does not support recent optimism about direct planting of diverse native species and suggests that a nurse crop of exotic species may be necessary, at least on the more degraded sites.},

EP may help make forest management financially attractive and thereby reduce forest conversion to other uses but many factors deter landholders from EP, including a lack of reliable information about its costs and benefits. A financial appraisal of an eastern Amazon EP case study is presented with 7 alternate scenarios: high and low financial costs, low timber yield, carbon sequestration payments, higher timber prices, free seedlings, and reduced discount rates. A sensitivity analysis of carbon payment amounts, timber prices, and discount rates is explored. The net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and benefit cost ratio (BCR) are reported for each scenario. Results showed that start-up costs must be kept low, and site maintenance must not only be sustained but also kept minimal to prevent costs from exceeding financial benefits of EP. Scenarios with the best NPV and BCR were those with carbon sequestration sales, higher timber prices, and a low discount rate. Carbon sequestration and high timber sale prices resulted in the best IRRs. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Plant-herbivore interactions shape community dynamics across marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats. From amphipods to elephants and from algae to trees, plant-herbivore relationships are the crucial link generating animal biomass (and human societies) from mere sunlight. These interactions are, thus, pivotal to understanding the ecology and evolution of virtually any ecosystem. Here, we briefly highlight recent advances in four areas of plant-herbivore interactions: (1) plant defense theory, (2) herbivore diversity and ecosystem function, (3) predation risk aversion and herbivory, and (4) how a changing climate impacts plant-herbivore interactions. Recent advances in plant defense theory, for example, highlight how plant life history and defense traits affect and are affected by multiple drivers, including enemy pressure, resource availability, and the local plant neighborhood, resulting in trait-mediated feedback loops linking trophic interactions with ecosystem nutrient dynamics. Similarly, although the positive effect of consumer diversity on ecosystem function has long been recognized, recent advances using DNA barcoding to elucidate diet, and Global Positioning System/remote sensing to determine habitat selection and impact, have shown that herbivore communities are probably even more functionally diverse than currently realized. Moreover, although most diversity-function studies continue to emphasize plant diversity, herbivore diversity may have even stronger impacts on ecosystem multifunctionality. Recent studies also highlight the role of risk in plant-herbivore interactions, and risk-driven trophic cascades have emerged as landscape-scale patterns in a variety of ecosystems. Perhaps not surprisingly, many plant-herbivore interactions are currently being altered by climate change, which affects plant growth rates and resource allocation, expression of chemical defenses, plant phenology, and herbivore metabolism and behavior. Finally, we conclude by noting that although the field is advancing rapidly, the world is changing even more rapidly, challenging our ability to manage these pivotal links in the food chain.},

   abstract = {Plant–herbivore interactions have evolved in response to coevolutionary dynamics, along with selection driven by abiotic conditions. We examine how abiotic factors influence trait expression in both plants and herbivores to evaluate how climate change will alter this long-standing interaction. The paleontological record documents increased herbivory during periods of global warming in the deep past. In phylogenetically corrected meta-analyses, we find that elevated temperatures, CO2 concentrations, drought stress and nutrient conditions directly and indirectly induce greater food consumption by herbivores. Additionally, elevated CO2 delays herbivore development, but increased temperatures accelerate development. For annual plants, higher temperatures, CO2 and drought stress increase foliar herbivory. Our meta-analysis also suggests that greater temperatures and drought may heighten florivory in perennials. Human actions are causing concurrent shifts in CO2, temperature, precipitation regimes and nitrogen deposition, yet few studies evaluate interactions among these changing conditions. We call for additional multifactorial studies that simultaneously manipulate multiple climatic factors, which will enable us to generate more robust predictions of how climate change could disrupt plant–herbivore interactions. Finally, we consider how shifts in insect and plant phenology and distribution patterns could lead to ecological mismatches, and how these changes may drive future adaptation and coevolution between interacting species.},

   abstract = {Incidences of oak decline have occurred repeatedly during the past three centuries as well as in the most recent decades. On the basis of historical records and dendrochronological measurements, oak decline in Central Europe has been attributed to the single or combined effects of climatic extremes (winter frost, summer drought), defoliating insects, and pathogenic fungi. Starting from a literature review, we discuss the possible roles of various abiotic (air pollution, nitrogen eutrophication, soil chemical stress, climatic extremes, site conditions) and biotic factors (insect defoliation, borer attack, infection by pathogenic fungi, microorganisms) that have been related to oak decline. On the basis of investigations on Quercus petraea and Quercus robur at three different levels (from experiments with young trees to monitoring on a supraregional scale), we suggest a conceptual model of the interaction of abiotic and biotic factors responsible for the onset of oak decline. This model should be valid for Central European oak stands at more acidic sites (soil pH (H2O) ≤ 4.2; on soils with higher pH, pathogenic Phytophthora species may contribute to oak decline). The combination of severe insect defoliation in at least two consecutive years with climatic extremes is the most significant complex of factors in the incidence of oak decline. Combined with defoliation, summer drought or winter/spring frost or both have to occur within the same year or in consecutive years to trigger major outbreaks of decline. Important additional stress factors are the following: (1) hydromorphic site conditions which, particularly in the case of Q. robur, render the trees more susceptible to drought stress as a result of an impairment of root growth in the subsoil; and (2), possibly, excess nitrogen which, in combination with drought stress, results in distinct decreases in the foliar concentrations of allelochemicals in Q. robur, thereby probably making the trees more susceptible to insect defoliation. Air pollution, soil chemical stress (including excess manganese), and nitrogen-induced nutritional imbalance do not seem to be important causal factors in the complex of oak decline. On the basis of the model, the appearance of the most recent oak decline in North-western Germany can be adequately explained.},

   abstract = {Damage due to wind-storms and droughts is increasing in many temperate forests, yet little is known about the long-term roles of these key climatic factors in forest dynamics and in the carbon budget. The objective of this study was to estimate individual and coupled effects of droughts and wind-storms on adult tree mortality across a 31-year period in 115 managed, mixed coniferous forest stands from the Western Alps and the Jura mountains. For each stand, yearly mortality was inferred from management records, yearly drought from interpolated fields of monthly temperature, precipitation and soil water holding capacity, and wind-storms from interpolated fields of daily maximum wind speed. We performed a thorough model selection based on a leave-one-out cross-validation of the time series. We compared different critical wind speeds (CWSs) for damage, wind-storm, and stand variables and statistical models. We found that a model including stand characteristics, drought, and storm strength using a CWS of 25 ms−1 performed the best across most stands. Using this best model, we found that drought increased damage risk only in the most southerly forests, and its effect is generally maintained for up to 2 years. Storm strength increased damage risk in all forests in a relatively uniform way. In some stands, we found positive interaction between drought and storm strength most likely because drought weakens trees, and they became more prone to stem breakage under wind-loading. In other stands, we found negative interaction between drought and storm strength, where excessive rain likely leads to soil water saturation making trees more susceptible to overturning in a wind-storm. Our results stress that temporal data are essential to make valid inferences about ecological impacts of disturbance events, and that making inferences about disturbance agents separately can be of limited validity. Under projected future climatic conditions, the direction and strength of these ecological interactions could also change.},

Trees occupied by this antagonist suffered increased attack by stem-boring beetles, grew more slowly, and experienced doubled mortality relative to trees occupied by the mutualistic ant. These results show that large mammals maintain cooperation within a widespread symbiosis and suggest complex cascading effects of megafaunal extinction.},

   abstract = {Animals translocate nutrients by consuming nutrients at one point and excreting them or dying at another location. Such lateral fluxes may be an important mechanism of nutrient supply in many ecosystems, but lack quantification and a systematic theoretical framework for their evaluation. This paper presents a mathematical framework for quantifying such fluxes in the context of mammalian herbivores. We develop an expression for lateral diffusion of a nutrient, where the diffusivity is a biologically determined parameter depending on the characteristics of mammals occupying the domain, including size-dependent phenomena such as day range, metabolic demand, food passage time, and population size. Three findings stand out: (a) Scaling law-derived estimates of diffusion parameters are comparable to estimates calculated from estimates of each coefficient gathered from primary literature. (b) The diffusion term due to transport of nutrients in dung is orders of magnitude large than the coefficient representing nutrients in bodymass. (c) The scaling coefficients show that large herbivores make a disproportionate contribution to lateral nutrient transfer. We apply the diffusion equation to a case study of Kruger National Park to estimate the conditions under which mammal-driven nutrient transport is comparable in magnitude to other (abiotic) nutrient fluxes (inputs and losses). Finally, a global analysis of mammalian herbivore transport is presented, using a comprehensive database of contemporary animal distributions. We show that continents vary greatly in terms of the importance of animal-driven nutrient fluxes, and also that perturbations to nutrient cycles are potentially quite large if threatened large herbivores are driven to extinction. © 2013 Wolf et al.},

   abstract = {Wild ungulates such as red deer, roe deer and wild boar are key drivers of forest ecosystems. Across the northern hemisphere, their range and abundance is increasing, while at the same time forest conversion and habitat fragmentation have led to a large variation in ungulate density and composition among areas. Understanding ungulate density impacts are important in order to prevent shifts towards undesired states, such as from forest to heathland. Here, we assess the effects of ungulate density on forest regeneration, development and functioning. We carried out a systematic literature review of 433 published studies in temperate forests, and used the data to model dose-response curves of the effects of ungulate density on three sets of forest attributes; tree regeneration (abundance, species richness and composition), forest structure (horizontal and vertical), and forest functioning (nutrient cycling in soil, timber and food production). Ungulate density averaged 23.6 km−2 across studies. Ungulates had a negative effect on forest regeneration, structure and functioning in 70% of the evaluated cases. The dose-response curves had a sigmoidal, rather than a unimodal shape. Critical tipping points, where ungulates started to have a negative effect on forest regeneration, were found at an ungulate metabolic weight density of 115 kg km−2 for forest regeneration, 141 kg km−2 for forest structure, and 251 kg km−2 for forest functioning, which is roughly equivalent to 10, 13 and 23 roe deer per km−2. Forest regeneration was most sensitive to immediate browsing and trampling impacts of small seedlings, while forest functioning was least sensitive because of time lags.

   abstract = {Declines in forest and woodland birds have largely been attributed to habitat loss and fragmentation. In the past decade, however, the potential for herbivores to influence bird species abundance and community composition via their direct impact on vegetation structure has also been recognised. We tested the hypothesis that deer influence vegetation structure and bird assemblages in a large island archipelago in western North America using surveys of 18 islands with deer densities ranging from 0 to over 1 deer/ha. Amongst these islands, reduced predation and hunting pressure has allowed deer populations to increase above those likely to have existed in pre-European times. Our results support a growing body of evidence that deer regulate both the cover and architecture of understory vegetation which in turn profoundly affects island bird assemblages. Deer-free islands supported the most abundant and diverse bird fauna. Iconic songbirds such as the rufous hummingbird, song and fox sparrow were abundant on islands with no deer but substantially reduced on islands with high deer densities. Only one bird species, the dark-eyed junco, preferred moderate and high density deer islands. Our observations suggest that current cohorts of palatable shrubs on islands with high deer densities are relatively old and potentially represent an impending extinction debt, where the full effects of high deer density on island biota may take decades to fully unfold. Our results suggest that deer densities below a threshold of 0.1 deer/ha should allow native vegetation to recover and a rich and diverse bird species assemblage to persist. We suggest that adaptive management be used to test the validity of this threshold, and that without active management of deer abundance, local extinctions of native flora and fauna appear likely to accelerate. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Large domestic and native ungulates have the potential to disperse large quantities of seeds throughout the landscape. Many studies have found that ungulates are capable of dispersing seeds but few quantify the relative importance of ungulate dispersal across the landscape. We investigated the potential for cattle, elk, and deer to disperse native and exotic plants in two different western North American ecosystems in northeast Oregon. We collected fecal samples of cattle, elk and deer that had been deposited during the current growing season. In the greenhouse we monitored the density and species richness of seedlings that germinated from the fecal samples. All three species act as seed dispersers for native and exotic plants. Cattle fecal pats had a higher species richness and density of exotic grasses germinating compared to the other ungulates; elk had a higher species richness and density of native and exotic forbs compared to the other ungulates. We then projected the number of seeds that each animal could disperse during a growing season. We predict that cattle disperse more than an order of magnitude more seeds than elk and deer per animal. Cattle, elk and deer interact with the landscape in different ways and this can have important ramifications for plant communities at local and regional scales. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Dispersal is a key process in metapopulation dynamics as it conditions species' spatial responses to gradients of abiotic and biotic conditions and triggers individual and gene flows. In the numerous plants that are dispersed through seed consumption by herbivores (endozoochory), the distance and effectiveness of dispersal is determined by the combined effects of seed retention time in the vector's digestive system, the spatial extent of its movements, and the ability of the seeds to germinate once released. Estimating these three parameters from experimental data is therefore crucial to calibrate mechanistic metacommunity models of plant-herbivore interactions. In this study, we jointly estimated the retention time and germination probability of six herbaceous plants transported by roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), red deer (Cervus elaphus), and wild boar (Sus scrofa) through feeding experiments and a Bayesian dynamic model. Retention time was longer in the nonruminant wild boar (>36 h) than in the two ruminant species (roe deer: 18-36 h, red deer: 3-36 h). In the two ruminants, but not in wild boar, small and round seeds were excreted faster than large ones. Low germination probabilities of the excreted seeds reflected the high cost imposed by endozoochory on plant survival. Trait-mediated variations in retention time and germination probability among animal and plant species may impact plant dispersal distances and interact with biotic and abiotic conditions at the release site to shape the spatial patterns of dispersed plant species.},

   abstract = {Mast seeding in temperate oak populations shapes the dynamics of seed consumers and numerous communities. Mast seeding responds positively to warm spring temperatures and is therefore expected to increase under global warming. We investigated the potential effects of changes in oak mast seeding on wild boar population dynamics, a widespread and abundant consumer species. Using long-term monitoring data, we showed that abundant acorn production enhances the proportion of breeding females. With a body-mass-structured population model and a fixed hunting rate of 0.424, we showed that high acorn production over time would lead to an average wild boar population growth rate of 1.197 whereas non-acorn production would lead to a stable population. Finally, using climate projections and a mechanistic model linking weather data to oak reproduction, we predicted that mast seeding frequency might increase over the next century, which would lead to increase in both wild boar population size and the magnitude of its temporal variation. Our study provides rare evidence that some species could greatly benefit from global warming thanks to higher food availability and therefore highlights the importance of investigating the cascading effects of changing weather conditions on the dynamics of wild animal populations to reliably assess the effects of climate change.},

Changes in legislation regarding poaching, abandonment of land and re-naturalisation of habitats, and decreasing numbers of hunters, among other things, have led to alarming scenarios in wild ungulate biology. Although ungulates bring some financial benefits for ecosystems and society through tourism and hunting, the problems associated with populations that are no longer controlled can outweigh the advantages. Damage to forestry and agriculture, ungulate-vehicle collisions, and diseases are among the most concerning problems related to ungulate overabundance. To deal with these problems and to decide on the best management strategy to apply, it is essential to have tools available to monitor populations with an integrative approach based on ecological change indicators, and to assess population and ecosystem status. Furthermore, in a globalised world, people’s opinions matter, and sociological studies regarding human perception of wild mammals must take place in order to allow proper management, including consideration of people’s expectations as well as animal and ecosystem needs. Successful and unsuccessful management strategies have already been attempted, and the knowledge of consequences over time enables an adaptive approach. Management of ungulate populations is a complex subject, and each case should be studied, analysing the cost_performance balance of measures to be taken, and ensuring ongoing financial means to carry out and continue with successful ecosystem management strategies. Multidisciplinary teams should be built, including biologists, veterinarians, stakeholders, sociologists, and others, to deal with the management of European wild ungulate populations.},

Preventing and mitigating collisions with wildlife will require a better understanding of the environmental and biological drivers of collision risks. Because species of large mammals differ in terms of food requirements, habitat selection and movement behaviors we tested, at the management unit level, if the density of collisions with red deer, roe deer and wild boar differed in terms of spatial distribution and explanatory factors. From 20,275 documented collisions in France between years 1990 and 2006, we found marked differences in the most influential environmental factors accounting for the density of collisions among the three large herbivore species. The effect of road density was higher for the red deer than for the two other species and did not level off at our spatial-scale of observation. As expected, the annual hunting harvest—interpreted as a proxy of population abundance—was positively associated with the density of collisions for all species, being the strongest for red deer. While the collision density decreased with the proportion of forest in a management unit for wild boar, it increased with the fragmentation of forest for red deer that commute among forest patches between day and night. To reduce the number of wildlife–vehicle collisions, our results suggest to generalize road fencing and/or a control of abundance of large herbivore populations. Mitigation measures should target units where the collision risk is the highest for the most problematic species.},

That is, population cycles help give rise to spatial synchrony. Here we demonstrate this process can work in reverse, with synchrony causing population cycles. We show that timescale-specific environmental effects, by synchronising local population dynamics on certain timescales only, cause major population cycles over large areas in white-tailed deer. An important aspect of the new mechanism is specificity of synchronising effects to certain timescales, which causes local dynamics to sum across space to a substantial cycle on those timescales. We also demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, that synchrony can be transmitted not only from environmental drivers to populations (deer), but also from there to human systems (deer-vehicle collisions). Because synchrony of drivers may be altered by climate change, changes to population cycles may arise via our mechanism.},

However, the causes and consequences of seedling herbivory have received remarkably little attention, despite the fact that plants tend to be most susceptible to herbivory during establishment, and this damage can alter community composition and structure.ScopeIn this Viewpoint article we review why herbivory during early plant ontogeny is important and in so doing introduce an Annals of Botany Special Issue that draws together the latest work on the topic. In a synthesis of the existing literature and a collection of new studies, we examine several linked issues. These include the development and expression of seedling defences and patterns of selection by herbivores, and how seedling selection affects plant establishment and community structure. We then examine how disruption of the seedling-herbivore interaction might affect normal patterns of plant community establishment and discuss how an understanding of patterns of seedling herbivory can aid our attempts to restore semi-natural vegetation. We finish by outlining a number of areas where more research is required. These include a need for a deeper consideration of how endogenous and exogenous factors determine investment in seedling defence, particularly for the very youngest plants, and a better understanding of the phylogenetic and biogeographical patterns of seedling defence. There is also much still be to be done on the mechanisms of seedling selection by herbivores, particularly with respect to the possible involvement of volatile cues. These inter-related issues together inform our understanding of how seedling herbivory affects plant regeneration at a time when anthropogenic change is likely to disrupt this long-established, but all-too-often ignored interaction. © The Author 2013.},

   abstract = {We consider the role that key structural traits, such as spinescence, pubescence, sclerophylly and raphides, play in protecting plants from herbivore attack. Despite the likelihood that many of these morphological characteristics may have evolved as responses to other environmental stimuli, we show that each provides an important defence against herbivore attack in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. We conclude that leaf-mass-area is a robust index of sclerophylly as a surrogate for more rigorous mechanical properties used in herbivory studies. We also examine herbivore counter-adaptations to plant structural defence and illustrate how herbivore attack can induce the deployment of intensified defensive measures. Although there have been few studies detailing how plant defences vary with age, we show that allocation to structural defences is related to plant ontogeny. Age-related changes in the deployment of structural defences plus a paucity of appropriate studies are two reasons why relationships with other plant fitness characteristics may be obscured, although we describe studies where trade-offs between structural defence and plant growth, reproduction, and chemical defences have been demonstrated. We also show how resource availability influences the expression of structural defences and demonstrate how poorly our understanding of plant structural defence fits into contemporary plant defence theory. Finally, we suggest how a better understanding of plant structural defence, particularly within the context of plant defence syndromes, would not only improve our understanding of plant defence theory, but enable us to predict how plant morphological responses to climate change might influence interactions at the individual (plant growth trade-offs), species (competition), and ecosystem (pollination and herbivory) levels. © 2007 Rübel Foundation, ETH Zürich.},

In contrast, moose may become physiologically stressed in response to warming, and increasing deer populations spreading disease will exacerbate the problem.

As hunting is the main cause of mortality for this species, we reviewed wild boar hunting bags and hunter population trends in 18 European countries from 1982 to 2012. Hunting statistics and numbers of hunters were used as indicators of animal numbers and hunting pressure. The results confirmed that wild boar increased consistently throughout Europe, while the number of hunters remained relatively stable or declined in most countries. We conclude that recreational hunting is insufficient to limit wild boar population growth and that the relative impact of hunting on wild boar mortality had decreased. Other factors, such as mild winters, reforestation, intensification of crop production, supplementary feeding and compensatory population responses of wild boar to hunting pressure might also explain population growth. As populations continue to grow, more human-wild boar conflicts are expected unless this trend is reversed. New interdisciplinary approaches are urgently required to mitigate human-wild boar conflicts, which are otherwise destined to grow further.},

   abstract = {Deer (Cervidae) populations are increasing across the temperate zone, threatening forest biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, the fundamental question of what factors make a forest susceptible to deer damage remains unanswered, hampering efforts to mitigate against damage. Previous research has assumed that deer density consistently increases forest damage. However, the effect of deer density is likely to be contingent on a range of other drivers, such as climate and landscape structure. Mitigation measures are expensive, so a sound understanding of these contingencies is required to inform the targeting of appropriate management to forests most at risk of damage. Using records of forest damage from Britain's National Forest Inventory, which comprises over 15,000 plots spanning environmental gradients, we applied a multiscale approach to identify the drivers of forest susceptibility to damage by deer. Damage likelihood was dependent on drivers operating at multiple spatial scales and their interactions. Broadleaved stands with low tree densities and old trees were consistently found to be at high risk across Britain. The statistical influence of surrounding forest cover within 500 m of a site was modified by regional deer density and climate, in addition to landscape-level perennial cover. The effect of deer density on damage was therefore not straightforward, but context dependent. Synthesis and applications. We predict the likely outcome of afforestation initiatives on the likelihood that a forest site will be damaged by deer, with important implications for management and landscape planning in Britain. The complex interactive effects uncovered are difficult to interpret.

Roe deer are income breeders, with high levels of allocation to reproduction, and are hence strongly constrained by the availability of high quality resources during spring. We investigated how recent climate change has influenced demographic processes in two populations of this widespread species. Spring began increasingly earlier over the study, allowing us to identify 2 periods with contrasting onset of spring. Both populations grew more slowly when spring was early. As expected for a long-lived and iteroparous species, adult survival had the greatest potential impact on population growth. Using perturbation analyses, we measured the relative contribution of the demographic parameters to observed variation in population growth, both within and between periods and populations. Within periods, the identity of the critical parameter depended on the variance in growth rate, but variation in recruitment was the main driver of observed demographic change between periods of contrasting spring earliness. Our results indicate that roe deer in forest habitats cannot currently cope with increasingly early springs. We hypothesise that they should shift their distribution to richer, more heterogeneous landscapes to offset energetic requirements during the critical rearing stage. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS.},

   abstract = {Background: The largest terrestrial species in the order Carnivora are wide-ranging and rare because of their positions at the top of food webs. They are some of the world's most admired mammals and, ironically, some of the most imperiled. Most have experienced substantial population declines and range contractions throughout the world during the past two centuries. Because of the high metabolic demands that come with endothermy and large body size, these carnivores often require large prey and expansive habitats. These food requirements and wide-ranging behavior often bring them into confl ict with humans and livestock. This, in addition to human intolerance, renders them vulnerable to extinction. Large carnivores face enormous threats that have caused massive declines in their populations and geographic ranges, including habitat loss and degradation, persecution, utilization, and depletion of prey. We highlight how these threats can affect the conservation status and ecological roles of this planet's 31 largest carnivores. Advances: Based on empirical studies, trophic cascades have been documented for 7 of the 31 largest mammalian carnivores (not including pinnipeds). For each of these species (see fi gure), human actions have both caused declines and contributed to recovery, providing "natural experiments" for quantifying their effects on food-web and community structure. Large carnivores deliver economic and ecosystem services via direct and indirect pathways that help maintain mammal, avian, invertebrate, and herpetofauna abundance or richness. Further, they affect other ecosystem processes and conditions, such as scavenger subsidies, disease dynamics, carbon storage, stream morphology, and crop production. The maintenance or recovery of ecologically effective densities of large carnivores is an important tool for maintaining the structure and function of diverse ecosystems. Outlook: Current ecological knowledge indicates that large carnivores are necessary for the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem function. Human actions cannot fully replace the role of large carnivores. Additionally, the future of increasing human resource demands and changing climate will affect biodiversity and ecosystem resiliency. These facts, combined with the importance of resilient ecosystems, indicate that large carnivores and their habitats should be maintained and restored wherever possible. Preventing the extinction of these species and the loss of their irreplaceable ecological function and importance will require novel, bold, and deliberate actions. We propose a Global Large Carnivore Initiative to coordinate local, national, and international research, conservation, and policy.},

   abstract = {A major problem within forestry is winter browsing on young Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) by European moose (Alces alces). Moose are selective foragers and make foraging decisions on many scales, for example, they avoid trees with high levels of plant defensive compounds, which reduce digestibility. Bark extract from Norway spruce (Picea abies) is known to have high levels of such defensive compounds. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Norway spruce bark extract as a repellent to European moose. Spruce bark was extracted in a conventional way with ethanol as the solvent, creating a solution that was applied to the apical leader of young pine trees in planted forests. In two field trials in northern Sweden (winter 2017–2018 and winter 2018–2019), the apical leader of young pine trees (height 1–2.5 m) were sprayed with bark extract from Norway spruce. A total of 5247 pine trees were included in the study. The field trials showed that spruce bark extract lowered the number of browsed apical leader of pine trees, and directed moose to browse less valuable lateral shoots, and neighboring trees. During the first field trial, apical leaders were treated every second meter along transects with a concentration of the spruce bark extract of 2.8% by dry weight. The level of browsed apical leaders changed from 15.1% to 6.8% of all apical leaders. During the second field trial, apical leaders were treated in circular plots, in which all main stems inside the circle were treated with a concentration of the spruce bark extract of 5.0% by dry weight. The level of browsed apical leaders changed from 19.5% to 4.7% of all apical leaders. Hence, results show that spruce bark extract (a non-toxic forest byproduct) can function as an efficient repellent. The bark extract can control browsing to a level that is considered acceptable – generally a maximum of 5% of all apical leaders browsed every year. This would result in approximately 7 out of 10 trees, in treated small scale areas, having unbrowsed apical leaders when the trees reach a height at which the apical leaders are safe from moose browsing.},

   abstract = {Background: Browsing repellents are widely used to deter large herbivores from consuming plants of ecological, economic and aesthetic importance. Understanding how these repellents function on a behavioural mechanistic level is critical to predicting effectiveness. Here, we illustrate how these mechanisms can be tested, by exposing a model mammalian herbivore, the fallow deer, to different concentrations of a commercial chemical repellent (HaTe2) in two-choice feeding trials. Results: The repellent acted as a defensive chemical for the food by both reducing visitation and the amount consumed. Deer favoured the less defended feeders before ingesting any food, suggesting that the repellent altered olfactory and/or visual cues. Deer also consumed less of the more defended food when choosing between low and high repellent feeders than no and low repellent feeders, indicating that the repellent modified flavour and/or sensation. Repellent effectiveness declined with increased exposure, suggesting that consumption had no negative post-ingestive effects, and thus, deterrence was not caused by a conditioned aversion or irritation. Instead, this pattern suggests that deer learned, through repeated sampling of repellent-treated food, that there was no adverse physiological effect of ingesting it. Conclusions: These results imply that HaTe2 repellent will not be effective over prolonged periods or in the absence of alternative untreated food. Understanding the mechanisms driving repellent function using two-choice trials could help practitioners decide whether a particular repellent is likely to be effective against mammalian herbivory in their management scenario.},

The nonhunting, non-animal-rights-advocate majority will determine the fate of hunting. Thus, a successful hunting ethic must be logically consistent and intuitively appealing to this moderate majority. This shared ethic could encourage cultural, political, and economic support for wildlife management from both hunters and nonhunters alike. In light of this goal, I argue that 3 dominant hunting ethics-the naturalness hypothesis, the land ethic, and the sporting ethic-fail to justify hunting or place it in a shared context with modern society, and I suggest an alternative ethic that combines Aldo Leopold's vision of an expanding community with traditional utilitarian and rights-based evaluations of ethical criteria within an n-dimensional moral framework. This conceptualization of an ethical system would allow the use of tools applicable to systems analysis in analyzing moral issues and would foster communicative practices capable of creating a more inclusive community. Further, it can both create and elucidate the ethical space shared by the moderate majority and hunters.},

Over one-quarter of respondents did not know enough about hunting over bait, trapping, and captive hunts to form an opinion about whether the practice reduced animal welfare. Chi-square tests were used to explore relationships between perceptions of hunters and hunting practices and demographics. Those who knew hunters, participated in hunting-related activities, visited fairs or livestock operations, or were males who had more favorable opinions on hunting. A logistic regression model showed that not knowing a hunter was a statistically significant negative predictor of finding it acceptable to hunt; owning a pet was statistically significant and negative for approving of hunting for a trophy.},

The effects of the repellents were assessed by comparing deer visitation rates to sand arenas before and after application of repellents and visitation rates to control arenas. Neither of the tested products reduced deer visitation rates. Rapid habituation to olfactory stimuli and lack of sensitivity to predator odours may explain the ineffectiveness of the repellents to alter the behaviour of the deer.

In this paper, we canvass the diverse factors that make up hunter identities and examine them for patterns and meaning. Our analysis places the phenomenon of social differentiation as it currently takes place in hunting in the context of responses to modernization. On this analysis, hunter identities are found to be rooted in defensive localism, class competition over resources, gender and moral affiliation, and the protection of the social legitimacy of hunting before an increasingly critical society. Our work is at once a synthesis of recurring hunting profiles across literature and field sites in Europe and a critical analysis of the significance of hunting communities of practice in future research, including serious leisure studies, nature-based recreation, criminology and rural sociology.},

One practical method of controlling deer damage is the use of exclusionary fences. The relatively high cost of labor and materials required to build effective fences has limited most applications to the protection of orchards, vegetable farms, other high-value resources, and mitigation of human health and safety risks. Improvements in fence technology resulting in less expensive, yet effective fences have expanded the use of fences to manage damage caused by deer. Fences typically installed to manage white-tailed deer damage include wire or plastic mesh, electrified high-tensile steel wire, and electrified polytape or polyrope fence. We reviewed the scientific literature on fencing to determine which fence designs would be the most effective for excluding deer in a variety of situations},

When the high-energy diet was treated with repellents, only blood (flavor modification) and capsaicin (irritation) proved highly effective.

Individual ecosystem functions generally show a positive asymptotic relationship with increasing biodiversity, suggesting that some species are redundant. However, ecosystems are managed and conserved for multiple functions, which may require greater biodiversity. Here we present an analysis of published data from grassland biodiversity experiments, and show that ecosystem multifunctionality does require greater numbers of species. We analysed each ecosystem function alone to identify species with desirable effects. We then calculated the number of species with positive effects for all possible combinations of functions. Our results show appreciable differences in the sets of species influencing different ecosystem functions, with average proportional overlap of about 0.2 to 0.5. Consequently, as more ecosystem processes were included in our analysis, more species were found to affect overall functioning. Specifically, for all of the analysed experiments, there was a positive saturating relationship between the number of ecosystem processes considered and the number of species influencing overall functioning. We conclude that because different species often influence different functions, studies focusing on individual processes in isolation will underestimate levels of biodiversity required to maintain multifunctional ecosystems. ©2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

   abstract = {During the 20th century, deer (Odocoileus spp.) populations in many parts of the USA changed from locally extirpated to locally overabundant. In 1997, two comprehensive books were published on deer overabundance to help wildlife professionals understand the complex biological, ecological, sociopolitical, public, and legal issues associated with managing overabundant deer. Since then, there have been several advances in dealing with deer overabundance, which have been briefly summarised in this review article. Most notably, since 1997 ecologists have more definitively characterised the ecological consequences of chronically overabundant deer populations, not merely in terms of direct impacts on plant communities but also in terms of cascading effects on animal communities. While still acknowledging the complexity of the interactions that affect ecosystem services and states (e.g. top-down pathways, bottom-up forces, disturbance regimes), ecologists now believe that the presence of an apex predator can affect the density, as well as behaviour and physiology of ungulates, and thereby help maintain the natural structure and functioning of plant communities. In some situations, wildlife researchers in the USA have restored native predators or documented adaptive responses by colonising predators, both of which have helped reduce locally overabundant deer populations and helped restore plant community diversity. On the wildlife policy front, some state wildlife agencies have enacted new programs to manage overabundant deer in protected areas and in urban and suburban settings. Examples include special permits for lethal removal of urban deer, as well as public hunts using special weapons (e.g. crossbows) or sharpshooting programs to control deer in state parks. A better understanding of the human dimensions associated with deer overabundance has helped many agencies define appropriate public education programs. However, despite these efforts to educate stakeholders about deer overabundance, there have been legal challenges associated with programs designed to control deer populations in some suburban communities. Some nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) have implemented award-winning, classroom-based educational modules to help children learn how to live with deer. Some NGOs also have stressed the importance of hunting as an ecological service. Still other NGOs have worked to facilitate linkages and cover liability concerns to enable bowhunters to help control deer in suburban communities. There also have been major advances in the potential for managing overabundant deer with fertility control, including the recent approval of an immunocontraceptive vaccine for use in deer (GonaCon™). In summary, wildlife biologists now understand the complex issues associated with deer overabundance better and there are more 'tools in the chest', both in terms of agency policies and management procedures than in 1997. Yet, human dimensions, public education, and stakeholder concerns continue to be the most challenging aspects of managing deer overabundance. Therefore, this issue likely will continue to confront wildlife professionals for many decades to come, whether in the USA or other parts of the world. © 2011 CSIRO.},

   abstract = {Increases in the distribution and abundance of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) throughout much of their range, coupled with hunter accessibility limitations, have prompted many state wildlife agencies to consider the future effectiveness of hunting as a population control mechanism under current regulatory systems. Wildlife managers in many areas experiencing abundant deer are questioning the conditions under which public hunting serves to control deer populations. In this article, we evaluate the performance of hunting as a deer population control mechanism and propose criteria to assess the effectiveness of public hunting for that purpose across the landscape, including rural and developed areas. We conclude that to control deer populations across broad landscapes, many wildlife agencies will have to adopt hunting regulations that are robust to 3 conditions: decrease in hunter numbers, increase in refugia that limit hunter access to deer, and increase in importance of urban and suburban areas as elements of deer range. To stabilize or reduce the high-density deer populations currently existing across much of white-tailed deer range, regulations need to give hunters incentives to shoot antlerless deer voluntarily or simply require them to do so. It is likely that comprehensive population control programs of the future will combine general recreational hunting regimes that promote great per-hunter harvests of antlerless deer across broad scales with complementary, site-specific, highly regulated hunts and programs to diminish the effects of refugia created by hunting-access limitations. Recreational hunting is unlikely to be sufficient as the sole management tool for most urban and suburban areas; other control methods will be part of integrated strategies for developed site. We use New York data to illustrate ideas presented in this paper to assess utility of an existing hunting program to control deer populations across broad landscapes.},

Most research on deer contraception has focused on the safety and efficacy of immunocontraceptive vaccines, but few studies have examined population-level effects. We report here results from two long-term studies of population effects of the porcine zona pellucida (PZP) immunocontraceptive vaccine, at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA, and at Fire Island National Seashore (FIIS), New York, USA. Annual population change at NIST was strongly correlated with population fertility (rP=0.82, P=0.001); when population fertility at NIST dropped below 0.40 fawns per female, the population declined. Contraceptive treatments at NIST were associated with a 27% decline in population between 1997 and 2002, and fluctuated thereafter with the effectiveness of contraceptive treatments. In the most intensively treated segment of FIIS, deer population density declined by ∼58% between 1997 and 2006. These studies demonstrate that, in principle, contraception can significantly reduce population size. Its usefulness as a management tool will depend on vaccine effectiveness, accessibility of deer for treatment, and site-specific birth, death, immigration, and emigration rates. © CSIRO 2008.},

On the other hand, neutral models, in which species do not interact and diversity is maintained by immigration and speciation, yield unrealistically small fluctuations in population abundance, and a strong positive correlation between a species' abundance and its age, contrary to empirical evidence. Models allowing for the robust persistence of large communities of interacting competitors are lacking. Here we show that very diverse communities could persist thanks to the stabilizing role of higher-order interactions, in which the presence of a species influences the interaction between other species. Although higher-order interactions have been studied for decades, their role in shaping ecological communities is still unclear. The inclusion of higher-order interactions in competitive network models stabilizes dynamics, making species coexistence robust to the perturbation of both population abundance and parameter values. We show that higher-order interactions have strong effects in models of closed ecological communities, as well as of open communities in which new species are constantly introduced. In our framework, higher-order interactions are completely defined by pairwise interactions, facilitating empirical parameterization and validation of our models.},

   abstract = {While both chronic white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmermann) overbrowsing and invasive shrubs have been linked to native regeneration failure in temperate hardwood forests, little is known of their relative importance and possible synergistic effects. Therefore, we established three study areas in Connecticut to examine the interaction of three levels of invasive shrub control and absence or presence of deer herbivory on forest regeneration over 9 years. Five observations suggest that obtaining forest regeneration requires a comprehensive management strategy. First, competitive interference by invasive shrubs in intact thickets continued to impede forest regeneration, especially taller seedlings, after deer were excluded. Second, density of small seedlings increased following removal of the competitive interference by invasive shrubs. Third, deer browsing depressed growth of small seedlings into taller height classes. Fourth, preferential browsing reduced species richness, especially in taller seedling classes, by favoring growth of low palatability species such as beech. Lastly, if a disturbance (e.g., cutting) does not kill the root system of the invasive shrubs, the window of forest regeneration recruitment may be narrow because invasive shrubs can quickly recover. In stands with both established shrub thickets and high deer densities, invasive shrub control and multiyear reduction of deer densities are both recommended to obtain adequate forest regeneration.},

   abstract = {Natural communities are well known to be maintained by many complex processes. Despite this, the practical aspects of studying them often require some simplification, such as the widespread assumption that direct, additive competition captures the important details about how interactions between species impact community diversity. More complex non-additive 'higher-order' interactions are assumed to be negligible or absent. Notably, these assumptions are poorly supported and have major consequences for the accuracy with which patterns of natural diversity are modelled and explained. We present a mathematically simple framework for incorporating biologically meaningful complexity into models of diversity by including non-additive higher-order interactions. We further provide empirical evidence that such higher-order interactions strongly influence species' performance in natural plant communities, with variation in seed production (as a proxy for per capita fitness) explained dramatically better when at least some higher-order interactions are considered. Our study lays the groundwork for a long-overdue shift in how species interactions are used to study the diversity of natural communities.},

   abstract = {Pepsin-cellulase digestibility determination is widely used to predict forage organic matter digestibility (OMd). Prediction equations were established in 1989 on 85 fresh forage or hay samples of pure species of grasses and legumes and on permanent grasslands rich in grasses. Some species like red clover, perennial ryegrass/white clover, as well as fermented forages (silages, wrapped big bales) were not included in this model. To extend and strengthen the prediction equations, we analysed the relation between the OMd and the pepsin-cellulase digestibility from a database containing 384 measurements of OMd performed on sheep at INRA Theix in Auvergne or at INRA Pin-au-Haras in Normandy. The determinations of pepsin-cellulase digestibility were all performed at INRA Theix. The database contains 269 measurements on fresh forages (121 grasses, 60 ryegrass - white clover mixtures, 32 legumes and 56 permanent grasslands), 64 measurements on fermented forages (39 grasses and 25 legumes) and 51 measurements on hays (37 grasses and 14 legumes)., OMd varied from 48.5 to 84.6 and pepsin-cellulase digestibility from 38.6 to 86.5, determined from the whole dataset. The analysis of the database allowed us to propose renewed prediction equations for fresh forages and hay with residual standard deviations between 2.2 and 2.9 points of digestibility, and to specify the differences in slope between grasses and legumes. A specific equation was proposed for rye-grass / white clover mixtures. New equations were also proposed to predict OMd of fermented forages with a residual standard deviation lower than 2 points of digestibility. A validation study was conducted on 122 external samples for which pepsin-cellulase was determined in a commercial laboratory. The standard error of prediction varied between 2.7 and 3.2 points of digestibility for the different forage types. It was lower than the standard error of prediction obtained from the chemical composition (crude fibre and crude protein) that varied between 3.5 and 5.1 points of digestibility.},

   abstract = {Research on plant tolerance to herbivory has been so far largely focussed on herbaceous plants partly due to the implicit assumption that woody plants are inherently lower in their compensatory potential as compared to herbs. However, tolerance to herbivory should be an important part of resistance of woody plants because their apparency to herbivory is high due to a large size and long life span, and their defence systems cannot completely exclude herbivory. Moreover, the longer life span, more complex modularity and higher sectorality of woody plants as compared to herbs imply that compensatory responses in woody plants may take several years to develop, and that consequences of herbivore damage to individual modules may profoundly differ from whole-plant responses. Therefore, short-term studies using branches or ramets as experimental units are likely to underestimate the tolerance of woody plants to herbivory. In addition, defoliation by insects (the most common type of herbivory experienced by woody plants) is less likely to release apical dominance and trigger biomass compensation than mammalian grazing on herbaceous plants. We conclude, therefore, that the seemingly different recovery potentials exhibited by woody and herbaceous plants are more likely to be the consequences of differences between the two types of plants in modular architecture, longevity and the type of herbivory they commonly experience rather than indications of inherent differences in compensatory ability.},

   abstract = {Identification of the ecosystem services provided by oak-dominated forests in southern Sweden is a prerequisite for ensuring their conservation and sustainable management. These forests seem well-suited for multiple-use forestry, but knowledge is limited regarding how to manage them for multiple uses. Management for the production of high-value timber species like oaks and management to conserve biodiversity, or for cultural services can be in conflict with each other. This study evaluates the capacity of three contrasting management regimes to provide societies with economic revenue from timber production, habitats for biodiversity and cultural services, and the study analyses associated trade-offs and synergies. The three regimes were: intensive oak timber production (A), combined management for both timber production and biodiversity (B) and biodiversity conservation without management intervention (C). We synthesized relevant scientific literature, governmental statistics and grey literature. Our assessments identified that Regime A provided the highest levels of economic returns and the lowest level of biodiversity. Regime C provided higher levels of habitat provision but at expense of wood production and cultural services. In contrast, Regime B provided a balanced delivery of timber production, biodiversity conservation and cultural services. We identified several stand-management options which provide comparatively synergistic outcomes in ecosystem services delivery. The use of these management options in combination with more traditional stand-management approaches may be a more effective means of achieving sustainable forest goods and services.

Sites were selected where naturally regenerated forest communities are developing on abandoned crop lands. Altitude ranges from 190 to 240 m a.s.l., while the abandonment period varied from 1 to 50 years at the time of the surveys (year 2007). The presence of younger stands (i.e., stands with age < 12 yrs) demonstrates a rapid invasion of abandoned farmlands by forest communities dominated by English oak mixed with other hardwoods, such as wild cherry and common elm. Observations conducted in older stands (i.e., stands with age ranging between 20 and 50 yrs) confirm the ability of English oak to generate well structured woodlands in the study area. In these environmental conditions previous cropping and exposure seem to play a significant influence on stand characteristics. Other noble hardwoods, such as wild cherry and common elm, are frequently associated with the oak. These stands showed a mean annual increment varying from 4 to 6 m3 ha-1 year-1 at the age of 45-50 yrs. At the present, black locust is only sporadic in the uppermost canopy layer and generally confined in the understory. The rapid colonization by Q. robur is favoured by the presence of adult oak trees in the field edges, providing abundant acorns efficiently dispersed by small rodents and birds. Oak stands observed in this study are worthy of notice in the light of the current decline of many adult oak communities in northern Italy, as well as for their potential to produce lumber and veneer logs. Therefore, these stands should be preserved avoiding coppicing or other irrational cuts. Further studies would be needed to analyze the contribution of soil characteristics to the colonization processes. © iForest - Biogeosciences and Forestry.},

   abstract = {Wooded pastures grazed by livestock are believed to be landscapes that provide favourable conditions for spontaneous regeneration of oaks, including Quercus robur. A key mechanism for oak regeneration in these systems is 'associational resistance', spatial association with unpalatable plants which offer protection against herbivory. There is little knowledge on how oak regenerates without livestock grazing and in the presence of only wild large herbivores. We studied this in an area (114ha) abandoned from agricultural use and in the early 1980s incorporated into the BiałowieŻa National Park, Poland. Its ungulate community consists of native red deer, European bison, roe deer, moose and wild boar. Secondary succession has led to the development of a mosaic habitat including tree and tall shrub groves (29% of the area), open meadow communities (60%), and edge, transitory zone between groves and meadows (11%). Our systematic inventory assigned oaks to height classes (0-0.2, 0.2-0.5, 0.5-1.3, 1.3-2.5, 2.5-5.0, >5.0m), dichotomous shape characteristic (regular vs. " bonsai" sapling), as well as a habitat definition, in particular the characteristics of woody vegetation in the immediate surroundings of oaks. A selection of 17 oaks was subject to coring for the comparison of growth dynamics. Oak density was highest inside groves, with 504oaksha-1, and in the edge zone (493oaksha-1) and lowest in meadows (47oaksha-1). Most of the 0-5-m oaks (62%) grew without another woody plant species within 1m radius. The remaining oaks (38%) were associated mainly with Rubus idaeus and saplings of Carpinus betulus and Populus tremula - all highly ungulate-preferred species. The age (0.5m above ground) of cored oaks in grove and edge habitats varied from 11 to 37years, indicating continuous recruitment since agricultural abandonment. The initial growth dynamics of the more mature oaks did not differ from that of present " bonsais," supporting the idea that browsing is not an unconditional impediment and that " bonsai" can be a temporary stage of successful oak development. In contrast to other studies, we found that associational resistance from unpalatable plants is not necessary to secure successful oak regeneration in woodlands subject to browsing by wild ungulates. This might have been possible because of the abundance of highly attractive vegetation making oak relatively unpreferred by ungulates. We suggest that the observed secondary succession provides a contemporary analogy of historic processes that resulted in the establishment of broadleaf forests with a substantial proportion of oak. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {In this review, we discuss the ecological and evolutionary consequences of plant-herbivore interactions in tropical forests. We note first that herbivory rates are higher in tropical forests than in temperate ones and that, in contrast to leaves in temperate forests, most of the damage to tropical leaves occurs when they are young and expanding. Leaves in dry tropical forests also suffer higher rates of damage than in wet forests, and damage is greater in the understory than in the canopy. Insect herbivores, which typically have a narrow host range in the tropics, cause most of the damage to leaves and have selected for a wide variety of chemical, developmental, and phenological defenses in plants. Pathogens are less studied but cause considerable damage and, along with insect herbivores, may contribute to the maintenance of tree diversity. Folivorous mammals do less damage than insects or pathogens but have evolved to cope with the high levels of plant defenses. Leaves in tropical forests are defended by having low nutritional quality, greater toughness, and a wide variety of secondary metabolites, many of which are more common in tropical than temperate forests. Tannins, toughness, and low nutritional quality lengthen insect developmental times, making them more vulnerable to predators and parasitoids. The widespread occurrence of these defenses suggests that natural enemies are key participants in plant defenses and may have influenced the evolution of these traits. To escape damage, leaves may expand rapidly, be flushed synchronously, or be produced during the dry season when herbivores are rare. One strategy virtually limited to tropical forests is for plants to flush leaves but delay 'greening' them until the leaves are mature. Many of these defensive traits are correlated within species, due to physiological constraints and tradeoffs. In general, shade-tolerant species invest more in defenses than do gap-requiring ones, and species with long- lived leaves are better defended than those with short-lived leaves.},

Recent advances in uncovering signal transduction networks have revealed that defense trade-offs are often the result of regulatory "decisions" by the plant, enabling it to fine-tune its phenotype in response to diverse environmental challenges. We place these results in the context of classic studies in ecology and evolutionary biology, and propose a unifying framework for growth-defense trade-offs as a means to study the plant's allocation of limiting resources. Pervasive physiological costs constrain the upper limit to growth and defense traits, but the diversity of selective pressures on plants often favors negative correlations at intermediate trait levels. Despite the ubiquity of underlying costs of defense, the current challenge is using physiological and molecular approaches to predict the conditions where they manifest as detectable trade-offs.},

   abstract = {For sustainable management of exploited populations, it is required to have good knowledge on temporal trends in population density to adapt the harvest. In this regard, hunting statistics are often collected routinely by government agencies and associations. These data are used to assess demographic trends through the development of indices, which are in turn used to manage exploited populations in a sustainable way. However, these population indices depend on features of the hunting process (e.g. hunting effort, hunting conditions, probability of catch). In this study, we show how to use hunting logs to assess demographic trends in exploited populations while accounting for the components of the hunting process. In particular, we developed a catch-effort model to study how the hunting effort leads to mortality rate – hunting pressure – within a given habitat type and during a given period. We illustrated the usefulness of this approach using exploited wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations as a case study. We used a large hunting logs dataset to perform our study, with several hundreds of thousands hunting events for more than 10 years in two French departments in France, including information about the number of hunters, of wild boars culled and the date of the hunt. We showed that catchability is a key parameter to assess hunting pressure at a given time and place. This parameter varies both within the hunting season and between habitat types. Once this variation in catchability was accounted for, our catch-effort model allowed us to obtain estimates of relative densities of wild boar populations over the study period at the management unit scale. Thus, catch-effort models are powerful tools to assess population density and to understand the underlying hunting process. Our study offers straightforward and reproducible conceptual framework that can be applied routinely by wildlife managers on exploited populations and practitioners from hunting statistics logs.},

   abstract = {Bark stripping by red deer (Cervus elaphus) causes considerable damage to Austrian forests, however, the incidence of bark stripping was never examined from large scale survey data. In this manuscript we present a logistic regression model for bark stripping damage (static model) and a model for recent (5-year period) bark stripping damage to previously undamaged trees (dynamic model) developed from Austrian National Forest Inventory data. Both models showed bark stripping damage to be most frequent in core red deer habitat areas and less frequent in less suitable habitat. Damage was concentrated at elevations of 400-1200 m and in alluvial forests (only static model). Norway spruce (Picea abies), European ash (Fraxinus excelsior), Sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa) and Sorbus spp. had 11-12 times more injuries than all the other species. Red deer preferred the smallest trees with a breast height diameter of 5 cm for bark stripping and damage probability decreased rapidly for trees with a breast height diameter greater than 25 cm. Our static model showed a maximum of bark stripping damage in stands with a mean height of 20 m. In the dynamic model the probability for bark stripping damage decreased with decreasing mean height. Also, in the static model the probability for bark stripping damage increased with increasing spruce proportion and with increasing stand density whereas in the dynamic model the proportion of previous bark stripping damage was a good predictor. Goodness of fit and discrimination of both models were good. In combination with forest growth models, the bark stripping models can be used to predict the risk of damage associated with different forest and habitat management options.},

We simulated wild boar grubbing in a fenced exclosure and an unfenced replicate and established two adjacent control plots, one fenced, the other unfenced. We evaluated if repeated soil bioturbation and game exclusion by fencing influence soil texture, soil chemical and soil biotic properties in the upper soil over a time period of 2 years. Soil bioturbation was conducted in November 2000 and 2001 creating a grubbing pattern similar to that found in naturally grubbed areas. Soil and fauna sampling was performed in spring and fall of the years 2001 and 2002. Soil bioturbation did not affect soil texture, pH and the contents of organic carbon and nitrogen. In contrast, the contents of potassium and magnesium, the microbial activity and the abundance of saprophageous and predatory soil arthropods were generally lower in grubbed plots compared to ungrubbed control plots (p≤0.05). The exclusion of game did not improve soil quality. On the contrary, microbial activity and the contents of organic carbon and total nitrogen were elevated outside the fenced exclosure (p≤0.05) which may be related to the deposition of urine and dung. Our study found that large mammals affect soil nutrient cycling in sloping oak forests either directly by the deposition of urine and dung or indirectly by accelerating nutrient leaching and disturbing the decomposer system in the soils. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {High densities of red deer can have severe impacts on soil nutrient status by removing the ground vegetation and enhancing erosion of the fertile soil layers. We compared four fenced deer exclosures with adjacent unfenced sites to evaluate the effect of deer grazing and trampling on the soil nutrient status (Corg, Nt, PO43-, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+) in sloping oak forests of a central European low mountain range. The investigation was set up as a three-factor randomized complete block design (RCBD) with the factors: fencing' (fenced/ unfenced), 'gradient' (gentle/steep) and 'aspect' (windward/leeward). We hypothesized that exclusion of red deer by fencing would increase soil nutrient contents independent of slope gradient and aspect. Fencing inc reased the contents of Corg, Nt, Ca2+ and PO43-, but only at the windward sites. This effect was less pronounced at the gently sloping site than at the steep site, which exhibited the lowest contents of Corg, Nt and PO43- of all sites. We did not find increased soil nutrients in the fenced exclosures at the leeward sites, neither at the steep nor at the gently sloping site. At both slope aspects nutrient contents (Corg, Nt, PO43-, K+) tended to be higher on the gentle than at the corresponding steep slopes. Our result s suggest that red deer trampling and grazing enhance the loss of soil nutrients at predisposed sites such as windward locations with a high slope gradient. Only at such sites did the exclusion of red deer increase several soil nutrients. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

   abstract = {1. The European roe deer Capreolus capreolus is a typical faunal element of the Holocene. It was already present in Europe at least 600 000 years ago and it has been known from both glacial and interglacial phases since then. With nearly 3000 fossil and subfossil records, it is one of the most frequent mammals in the Late Quaternary. 2. During the Middle and Late Weichselian Pleniglacial, the distribution of the roe deer was not restricted to the Mediterranean peninsulas but repeatedly reached regions of central Europe. In contrast to that, roe deer records from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 21.0-14.5 ka 14C BP) are largely confined to the Mediterranean peninsulas - with the exception of south-western France and the surroundings of the Carpathians where several records attest to its occurrence during the LGM. 3. During the Greenland Interstadial 1 (12.5-10.8 ka 14C BP), the species' distribution extended further north and the roe deer appeared north of the Alps and reached regions of central Germany. This seems to be correlated with the abrupt change to more favourable environmental conditions during this period. It is very likely that the roe deer disappeared north of the Alps during the Younger Dryas cooling (10.8-10.0 ka 14C BP). The northern regions of the central European lowlands were recolonized by roe deer during the late Preboreal 9.7-9.5 ka14C BP for the first time since the Weichselian Glacial. 4. The combined pattern of genetic data and fossil records of European roe deer suggests several regions in the Iberian peninsula, southern France, Italy and the Balkans as well as in the Carpathians and/or eastern Europe as glacial refugia. It further suggests that C. capreolus might have recolonized most parts of central-northern Europe out of one or more eastern European (not Balkan) and/or Carpathian refugia. This recolonization wave might have blocked immigration from the traditional Mediterranean areas. © 2008 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2008 Mammal Society.},

This is followed by an overview of the recent phylogeography of this species using haplogroup studies of recent molecular data. The implications of the synthesis of palaeontological and genetic data are discussed and we propose that present day European red deer haplogroup distributions are best explained against the history of late Quaternary population contractions into and expansions from glacial refugia. Around 800 records of Cervus elaphus were assigned to the period covering the later part of the Last Glacial and the Early to Middle Holocene. Red deer becomes increasingly visible in faunal assemblages dated to late OIS-3 (<40.0 ka14C BP). The species persisted throughout the LGM on the Iberian Peninsula, in adjacent regions of South-Western France (Gascony, Dordogne, Languedoc), on the Italian Peninsula, in the Balkans and Greece, and east of the Carpathians in Moldavia. We suggest that genetic exchange between the populations of the Balkans and the East of the Carpathians remained uninterrupted during the LGM. The expansion of red deer from its southern refugia into Central and Northern Europe begins rapidly at 12,50014C BP. The expansion of red deer coincides with the sudden rise in temperature at the onset of Greenland Interstadial 1e and the dispersion of open birch woodland into the northern half of Europe. Radiocarbon supported records show a more or less universal distribution of Cervus elaphus across Europe following the Pleistocene/Holocene climatic change at 10.0 ka14C BP for the first time. Molecular data and fossil record combined provide a clearer temporal and spatial pattern for the Lateglacial recolonisation process of the northern part of Europe. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This study is the first that uses a theoretical plant growth model to link leaf trade-offs to whole-plant performances and to differential performances across species in different light environments. Using data of 50 sympatric tree species from a Bolivian rain forest, we observed that specific leaf area and photosynthetic capacity codetermined interspecific height growth variation in a forest gap; that leaf survival rate determined the variation in plant survival rate under a closed canopy; that predicted height growth and plant survival rate matched field observations; and that fast-growing species had low survival rates for both field and predicted values. These results show how leaf trade-offs influence differential tree performance and tree species' coexistence in a heterogeneous light environment. © 2006 by The University of Chicago.},

By analysing worldwide variation in six major traits critical to growth, survival and reproduction within the largest sample of vascular plant species ever compiled, we found that occupancy of six-dimensional trait space is strongly concentrated, indicating coordination and trade-offs. Three-quarters of trait variation is captured in a two-dimensional global spectrum of plant form and function. One major dimension within this plane reflects the size of whole plants and their parts; the other represents the leaf economics spectrum, which balances leaf construction costs against growth potential. The global plant trait spectrum provides a backdrop for elucidating constraints on evolution, for functionally qualifying species and ecosystems, and for improving models that predict future vegetation based on continuous variation in plant form and function.},

   abstract = {Understanding how plant recovery from herbivory interacts with the resource environment is necessary to predict under what resource conditions plants are most affected by herbivory, and ultimately how herbivory impacts plant population dynamics. It has been commonly assumed that plants are generally best able to recover from herbivory when growing in high resource conditions, an assumption which is supported by some models (e.g., the continuum of responses model) but opposed by others (e.g., the growth rate model). The validity and generality of any effects of resources (light, nutrients, and water) on plant recovery from herbivory were tested with mixed-model, factorial meta-analyses using a log response ratio metric applied to plant growth and reproduction data from the ecological literature. In total, 81 records from 45 studies were included in the growth meta-analysis, and 24 records from 14 studies in the reproduction meta-analysis. High resource levels and the absence of herbivory both strongly increased plant growth and reproduction. There was no significant overall interaction between growth or reproduction after herbivory and resource conditions, but the interaction terms were significant for each plant functional group in the growth meta-analysis. Basal meristem monocots grew significantly more after herbivory in high resources, while both dicot herbs and woody plants grew significantly more after herbivory in low resources. A similar result was found in the 34.6% of growth records where exact- or overcompensation occurred. Overcompensation was more likely in high resources for monocots and in low resources for dicot herbs. The reproduction data set was too small to subdivide. These qualitative differences between monocot and dicot herbs and woody plants explain many of the contradictory results in the literature and show that no single current model can account for the responses of all plants to herbivory.},

   abstract = {In order to investigate how environmental factors other than light availability affect tree architecture, differences in branching architecture and allometry were analysed in populations of Acacia karroo Hein. from three different environments in South Africa: forests, savannas and arid-shrublands. Factors such as fire and herbivory have a large effect on tree life history in certain environments and are likely to have selected for trees that have different architectures from those of forest trees, whose major limitation is light assimilation. Significant differences were found in stem architecture and branching architecture between trees in each environment. Compared with forest trees, trees in savannas had an elongated growth form with small canopy and leaf areas, and tall, thin, unbranched trunks. Trees in arid areas showed opposite trends with wider canopies, and increased lateral branching. Savanna trees had significantly smaller spines than trees in other environments, and both forest and savanna trees showed delayed reproduction. These differences are probably related to a trade-off between an architecture geared towards rapid height-gain and one promoting lateral spread, and can be explained with reference to the different selective pressures in each environment. In forests, vertical and horizontal growth are both important. However, in savannas there is a great pressure for rapid vertical growth to escape fires, while in arid areas a defensive, lateral growth form is selected for. Savanna trees and arid karoo trees have evolved architectures that are more extreme vertically and laterally than the range of architectures displayed in a forest community.},

   abstract = {1. By comparing plant species under the same experimental field conditions, the direct effects of plant traits on ecosystem processes can be studied. We have analyzed the role of leaf traits (leaf lamina dry matter content, LDMC; leaf lamina N content, LNC and specific leaf lamina area, SLA) for the annual above-ground primary productivity (ANPP) and quality (pepsin-cellulase digestibility, crude protein content) for herbivores of 13 perennial C 3 pasture grass species. 2. These relationships were investigated over 2 years with monocultures grown in a fully factorial block design crossing the plant species, the cutting frequency and the N supply factors. 3. The within species variation in leaf traits, ANPP, digestibility and protein content was less than between species variation. Species ranks for leaf traits were conserved among N supply and cutting frequency levels. Highly significant (P < 0.001) between species allometric relationships were found for LNC × SLA and SLA × LDMC, with common slopes but differences in intercept and shifts among factor levels. 4. The between species variation in ANPP was strongly (P < 0.001) and negatively correlated with the fresh-matter based leaf N content (i.e. LDMC × LNC) and was not affected by SLA, apparently because of a trade-off between SLA and leaf lamina fraction. Digestibility increased with SLA and declined with LDMC. Protein content increased with both fresh and dry-matter based LNC. 5. N supply increased LNC and SLA but reduced LDMC. Cutting frequency increased LDMC and reduced LNC. In response to cutting frequency, changes in digestibility and in fresh-matter based LNC were positively correlated. 6. We conclude that the between species variation in the annual production of digestible energy and of proteins by pasture grasses is controlled in an additive way by two leaf traits: LNC and LDMC. © 2007 INRA.},

   abstract = {The objective of this study was to test whether diet selection of dairy cows under grazing conditions could be estimated using plant wax markers. Furthermore, differences between 2 cow strains and the effect of concentrate supplementation on plant species selection were investigated. The experiment was a study with a crossover design performed on an organic farm with 12 Swiss Holstein cows and 12 New Zealand Holstein cows. Both experimental periods consisted of a 21-d adaptation and a 7-d measurement period. All cows grazed full time in a rotational stocking system and received either no concentrate or 6 kg/d of a commercial cereal-grain mix. Representative herbage samples of each grazed paddock were taken and botanical composition of subsamples was manually determined. The average proportions of the plant species were 27.8% Lolium perenne, 6.1% Dactylis glomerata, 10.4% Trifolium repens, and 9.0% Taraxacum officinale. Other grass species were merged as “other grass” (38.2%) and other forb species as “other forbs” (8.5%). n-Alkanes, long-chain fatty acids, and long-chain alcohols (LCOH) were analyzed in the samples of plant species, concentrate, and feces from each cow. A linear discriminant analysis indicated that diet components were differentiated best with LCOH (96%) and worst with the combination of all marker groups together (12%). For each marker, the fecal marker recovery (FR) relative to dosed ytterbium was determined in 2 ways. Estimation of diet composition was performed with the software “EatWhat,” and results were compared with botanical composition with the Aitchison distance. The results indicate that the diet composition of grazing dairy cows can be estimated using plant wax markers. Additionally, the calculation of FR led to mostly reliable results, yet this approach needs further validation. The most accurate estimation was achieved with the marker combination of n-alkanes and LCOH with a correction for FR. Less accurate estimations were achieved with long-chain fatty acids alone or in combination with n-alkanes. No difference relating to diet selection between the 2 cow strains was recorded, but supplemented cows apparently ingested higher proportions of T. repens than nonsupplemented cows. Awareness that supplementation influences selection behavior of grazing dairy cows may lead to adaptations in botanical composition of the pasture according to the demand of the animals.},

In this review, we determine trends in the field; assess the utility of key techniques against five criteria (cost, accuracy and precision, resolution, utility for long-term monitoring programs, and appropriateness for browsers and grazers); and make recommendations to give managers appropriate tools. Three techniques stand out: microhistology, near infrared reflectance spectroscopy, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) barcoding. Microhistology has a long history of use in rangelands and is often considered the gold standard for understanding diet composition, albeit at a high cost of labor. Near infrared reflectance spectroscopy can resolve the presence of target groups or species more quickly than microhistology, especially for grazers. DNA barcoding provides the greatest resolution of dietary items with less quantitative certainty than microhistology. The costs associated with DNA barcoding come primarily from technology and sequencing, while in microhistology they are associated with labor. Therefore, an improved, streamlined microhistology method could provide rangeland managers a rapid and cost-effective method for diet monitoring. Ultimately, the complex challenges facing rangeland managers today may require the use of more than one method to achieve acceptable resolution within actionable time frames.},

Estimates of intake in ruminants are often based on separate measurements of faecal output and herbage digestibility. We review this approach and emphasize that, under some circumstances, the applicability of in vitro digestibility estimates based on OF extrusa is questionable. We discuss how plant-wax marker patterns can be used to check whether OF and test animals are consuming similar diets, but also emphasize that a major advantage of the use of plant-wax markers is that this approach may obviate altogether the need for OF animals. Estimates of total herbage intake can be partitioned into the intakes coming from different plant species and/or parts, provided diet composition can be measured. Diet composition estimates based on C-isotope discrimination have the major disadvantage that they cannot be taken to species level. By contrast, microhistological methods can identify many plant species in extrusa, digesta or faeces, but often a large proportion of plant fragments remains unidentifiable. Plant-wax hydrocarbons show great promise as markers for estimating diet composition and intake. However, we suggest that to be applicable in complex plant communities there is a need with this method either to recruit a wider range of wax markers (e.g. alcohols, sterols, fatty acids) or to use it in combination with other methods. We suggest that, in turn, this generates an urgent need for research on statistical aspects of the combined use of markers or methods, in relation to the error structures of the data or methods being combined and the standard errors of the resultant estimates of diet composition and intake. We conclude by discussing the extension of intake and/or diet composition measurements to the measurement of nutrient transactions within the gut, particularly in relation to the supply of absorbable nutrients. },

   abstract = {In mixed-species forest stands, large losses in tree species diversity often occur during the regeneration phase. In a former coppice-with-standards, we investigated whether the limiting stage in the recruitment process of advance regeneration is the immediate seedling response to canopy release. Experimental canopy gaps were opened and the survival and growth of advance seedlings (Fagus sylvatica, Acer pseudoplatanus, Acer campestre, Acer platanoides) growing in the gaps or under closed canopy were monitored for three years. All species responded positively and rapidly to canopy release. Survival was not affected by gap opening. Diameter increment after gap opening was similar across species, and height increment was greater for Acer platanoides and for Acer pseudoplatanus. Post-release diameter and height growth were mainly determined by pre-release seedling size. Competition from neighbouring seedlings did not affect growth in the three years following canopy opening. In the recruitment process of F. sylvatica and Acer sp. advance regeneration, the recovery from canopy release did not appear as a limiting step that would filter against some species. Pre-release size was the main factor accounting for post-release growth and is probably a major determinant of long-term seedling dominance. © 2009 INRA EDP Sciences.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Moose (Alces alces L.) populations and moose damage in forests are debated in Nordic countries with dense moose populations. Moose populations and food resources vary greatly, both spatially and temporally, and reliable data covering both variables simultaneously at the same scale have seldom been available. We modelled the effect of moose population density and forest resources on the area of moose damage at regional scale, referring to moose management areas (MMA). Forest data and moose damage data originated from the Finnish National Forest Inventory, and the moose population data came from a Bayesian moose model. For modelling, average values of moose population, damage and forest variables were calculated for the periods 2004–2008 and 2009–2013 for each MMA. The MMAs were further classified into one of four larger geographical zones. The area of moose damage was used as a dependent variable, and the proportions of different types of forests and moose population densities per land area or area of seedling stands as explanatory variables. The relationships were modelled with a linear mixed-effects model with an exponential spatial correlation structure. RESULTS: The area of moose damage was best explained by total forest area, proportions of plantations and mature forests, and moose population density per land area or the proportion of plantations. There were differences among the biogeographical zones in how different variables explained the amount of damage. CONCLUSION: The results provide tools for analyzing the regional effects of moose population density and the amount of food resources on the amount of moose damage. This information can be used in reconciling sustainable moose population levels and the amount of damage.},

   abstract = {Most forests today are multi-specific and heterogeneous forests ('mixed forests'). However, forest modelling has been focusing on mono-specific stands for a long time, only recently have models been developed for mixed forests. Previous reviews of mixed forest modelling were restricted to certain categories of models only and were generally not considering application and suitability. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of the models designed for or applied to modelling mixed forest growth and dynamics and to review the suitability of the different model types according to their intended purposes. The first part of the paper gives an overview of previous classifications, after which a new and overall classification scheme is presented. Next, the characteristics of the six modelling approaches that were distinguished are described: distance-dependent stand models, distribution models, average tree models, distance-dependent tree models, distance-independent tree models and gap models. All, except gap models, are close to mono-specific stands modelling approaches. The second part of the paper describes the main applications of these modelling approaches and presents a critical analysis of their suitability. Applications can be separated between growth and yield studies and forest dynamics simulation studies. Attention must be paid to recruitment sub-models, which appear to be inadequate in many models, but which highly influence the simulation outcome. All types of model were used as management tools. Stand level simulations fit the yield data better than tree level simulations, as a result of cumulated model errors from tree to stand level. However, tree level approaches seem most appropriate to understand stand growth as affected by competition between individuals of different species. Forest dynamics were mostly modelled using distribution models, gap models and distance-dependent tree models. The latter appeared to be less suitable because of the difficulties in modelling 3D stand structure over large periods and areas. Gap models could be applied to larger areas and time periods than distribution models, especially when they included detailed descriptions of the ecological functioning of the ecosystem. In sum the empirical models appeared more accurate in their predictions than mechanistic models, but they are highly dependent on the data used for parameterisation. That makes them unsuitable for extrapolation to other systems or conditions. Although mechanistic models can also be misused, adding mechanistic approaches to empirical observations is necessary to model the growth and dynamics of complex forest systems. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

   abstract = {Deer are regarded to be a keystone species as they play a crucial role in the way an ecosystem functions. Most deer–forest interaction studies apply a single scale — process of analyzing ecological interactions by only taking into account one dependent variable — to understand how deer browsing behavior shapes different forest components, but they overlook the fact that forests respond to multiple scales simultaneously. This research evaluates the effect of browsing by wild deer on temperate and boreal forests at different scales by synthesizing seminal papers, specifically (a) what are the effects of deer population density in forest regeneration? (b) What are the effects of deer when forests present diverging spatial characteristics? (c) What are the effects on vegetation at different temporal scales? and (d) What are the hierarchical effects of deer when considering other trophic levels? Additionally, a framework based on modern technology is proposed to answer the multiscale research questions previously identified. When analyzing deer–forest interactions at different scales, the strongest relationships occur at the extremes. For example: when deer assemblage occurs in low or high density and is composed of a mix of small and large species. As forests on poor soils remain restrained in size, isolated and chronically browsed. When forests harbor incomplete trophic levels, the effects spill over to lower trophic levels. To better understand the complexities in deer–forest interactions, researchers should combine technology-based instruments like fixed sensors and drones with field-tested methods such observational studies and experiments to tackle multiscale research questions.},

We hypothesized that foliar defences of plant species against vertebrate herbivores would reduce leaf digestibility and would subsequently, through 'afterlife effects', reduce litter decomposability. 2. We tested this hypothesis by screening 32 subarctic plant species, belonging to eight types in terms of life form and nutrient economy strategy, for (1) leaf digestibility in cow rumen juice; (2) biochemical and structural traits that might explain variation in digestibility; and (3) litter mass loss during simultaneous incubation in an outdoor subarctic litter bed. 3. Interspecific variation in green-leaf digestibility corresponded significantly with that in litter decomposability; this relationship was strongly driven by overall variation among the eight plant types (r = 0.92). The same relationship was not detectable within plant types in taxonomic relatedness tests. 4. Several biochemical and structural parameters (phenol-to-N ratio, lignin-to-N ratio) explained a significant part of the variation in leaf digestibility, but again only between and not within plant types. 5. Our results provide further support for the role played by foliar defence in the link between plant and soil via the decomposition pathway. They are also a new example of the potential control of plant functional types over carbon and nutrient dynamics in ecosystems.},

   abstract = {This study experimentally analyses the response to simulated herbivory of juvenile Scots pine of two different ages in contrasting abiotic scenarios, focusing on the potential dual role of browsing ungulates: negative, by removing aerial biomass, and positive, by stimulating compensation capacity and providing nutrients by depositing their excrement. Compensation against herbivory was investigated by experimentally clipping a set of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L. nevadensis) juveniles, grown under different levels of light and nutrient availability. The responses analysed were survival, trunk-diameter growth, leader-shoot growth, increment in number of meristems, RGR, biomass of needles, shoots, root and whole plant, and root-to-shoot ratio. Clipping consistently resulted in a worse survival and performance of pines with respect to unclipped ones. From the factors analysed, light availability was responsible mainly for the variations in plant performance, while the addition of nutrients was much less important. Age was also important, with older pines showing in general better performance after clipping. Overall, clipping invariably had a negative effect on Scots pine, since none of the combinations of abiotic factors used resulted in overcompensation. However, the intensity on this negative effect proved quite variable, from almost an exact compensation in clipped older pines under full sunlight availability to very poor performance and high death probability in younger pines in shade. Scots pine cannot overcompensate after clipping, but, depending of the environmental conditions, the negative result of clipping varies from severe undercompensation to almost exact compensation. Also, small differences in sapling age can promote significant differences in sapling response to clipping and light environment. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Tame roe deer were offered a choice of food pellets to which hydrolyzable chestnut tannins had been added or control pellets. The daily consumption of pellets containing a high level of tannins (9.1%) was lower than consumption of control pellets. However, when offered medium level tannin pellets (3.8%), roe deer ate more tannin than control pellets. Moreover, the roe regulated their intake of these tannins closely. The regression of tannin intake versus total pellet intake across all the tests was linear and precise (r2 = 0.94): intake was about 28 g of tannin per kilogram of pellets eaten. We therefore reject HI and suggest that roe can monitor tannin concentrations in their food, and regulate their intake precisely. The results suggest that a certain level of tannins induces no costs or that they provide a nutritional benefit for roe deer.},

When these objectives conflict, as occurs because of the cascading effects of large mammals (i.e., ungulates and large carnivores) on lower trophic levels, park managers have to decide upon the appropriate management while considering various local circumstances. 2. To analyse if ungulate management strategies are in accordance with the objectives defined for protected areas, we assessed the current status of ungulate management across European national parks using the naturalness concept and identified the variables that influence the management. 3. We collected data on ungulate management from 209 European national parks in 29 countries by means of a large-scale questionnaire survey. Ungulate management in the parks was compared by creating two naturalness scores. The first score reflects ungulate and large carnivore species compositions, and the second evaluates human intervention on ungulate populations. We then tested whether the two naturalness score categories are influenced by the management objectives, park size, years since establishment, percentage of government-owned land, and human impact on the environment (human influence index) using two generalized additive mixed models. 4. In 67.9% of the national parks, wildlife is regulated by culling (40.2%) or hunting (10.5%) or both (17.2%). Artificial feeding occurred in 81.3% of the national parks and only 28.5% of the national parks had a non-intervention zone covering at least 75% of the area. Furthermore, ungulate management differed greatly among the different countries, likely because of differences in hunting traditions and cultural and political backgrounds. Ungulate management was also influenced by park size, human impact on the landscape, and national park objectives, but after removing these variables from the full model the reduced models only showed a small change in the deviance explained. In areas with higher anthropogenic pressure, wildlife diversity tended to be lower and a higher number of domesticated species tended to be present. Human intervention (culling and artificial feeding) was lower in smaller national parks and when park objectives followed those set by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). 5. Our study shows that many European national parks do not fulfil the aims of protected area management as set by IUCN guidelines. In contrast to the USA and Canada, Europe currently has no common ungulate management policy within national parks. This lack of a common policy together with differences in species composition, hunting traditions, and cultural or political context has led to differences in ungulate management among European countries. To fulfil the aims and objectives of national parks and to develop ungulate management strategies further, we highlight the importance of creating a more integrated European ungulate management policy to meet the aims of national parks.},

To calibrate the model, we measured and mapped trees in 27 plots with structures ranging from secondary-successional oak forests to late-successional beech forests. We measured understory light and crown openness and verified that our forest radiative transfer model well captured the variability of understory light among the studied stands (R2=87%). We then compared cutting strategies varying in type and intensity and provided indications to promote the regeneration of mixtures of species of different shade tolerances. In particular, creating gaps of about 500m2 provided adequate light for small regeneration clumps. Cutting from below, species-specific cutting and uniform cutting were also appropriate for tree regeneration but uniform cutting required higher harvest intensity. Cutting from above slightly increased understory light and promoted more shade tolerant species. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {The potential utilisation of natural regeneration of European beech ( Fagus sylvatica L.) for forest conversion has received little attention to date. Ecological knowledge is necessary to understand and predict successful natural regeneration of beech. The objective of this study was to improve understanding of what drives the occurrence of beech regeneration and, once regeneration is present, what drives its density. In the study, we utilised a forest inventory dataset provided by Sachsenforst, the state forestry service of Saxony, Germany. The dataset was derived from 8725 permanent plots. Zero-altered negative binomial models (ZANB) with spatial random effects were used to analyse factors influencing occurrence and density simultaneously. The results provided by the spatial ZANB models revealed that the probability of the occurrence of beech regeneration is highly dependent on seed availability, i.e. dependent on source trees in close proximity to a plot. The probability of beech regeneration rises with the increasing diameter of a potential seed tree and decreases with increasing distance to the nearest potential seed source. The occurrence of regeneration is affected by overstorey composition and competition exerted by spruce regeneration. Where sites are affected by groundwater or temporary waterlogging, the impact on the occurrence of regeneration is negative. Although distance to the nearest potential seed source has an influence on occurrence, this variable exerts no influence on density. A high regeneration density arises in conjunction with a high beech basal area in the overstorey. Beech regeneration density, but not occurrence, is negatively affected by browsing intensity. These variables can be used to predict the occurrence and density of beech regeneration in space to a high level of precision. The established statistical tool can be used for decision-making when planning forest conversion using natural regeneration.},

   abstract = {Questions: How do deer mediate the response of forest ground-layer plant communities to canopy gap size?. Location: Flambeau River State Forest in north central Wisconsin, USA (47°37.4ʹ N, 90°47.8ʹ W). Method: We examined responses of resources, growth forms and temporal guilds to factorial combinations of canopy gap treatments consisting of a range of gap sizes (80, 200 and 380 m2), and deer (Odocoileus virginianus) exclusion (0.64 ha fenced exclosures) 4 years following gap creation (3 years following deer exclusion). We contrasted responses in central and transition zones. Results: In the absence of deer, forb productivity increased from pre-treatment levels, particularly where light transmittance and soil moisture were high. In contrast, forb productivity decreased in the presence of deer. These effects were stronger among forbs with early- and late-summer leafing phenology than spring ephemeral, and evergreen species. In contrast, deer amplified increases in graminoid productivity, which were related primarily to light transmittance. Deer did not alter responses of ferns, shrubs, trees seedlings or vines. Canopy gaps increased community heterogeneity among gap sizes and zones, but only in the absence of deer. This was related to the effects of deer on the composition and diversity of gap specialists. Conclusions: The maintenance of biodiversity in northern temperate forest ground-layer plant communities by canopy gap dynamics appears to hinge on deer herbivory, even at relatively modest populations of deer and a productive site. Conversely, increases in resource availability within gaps may function to mitigate some negative effects of deer on forb productivity. Effects may be transient, as species turnover to shrub- and sapling-dominated communities and canopy closure may cause communities to converge in the future. However, populations of undefended gap specialists remain particularly sensitive.},

Climate-sensitive disturbances, such as fire, land-use change, pests, and pathogens, often spread contagiously across the landscape. While the climate-change implications of these factors are often discussed, none of these processes are incorporated into earth system models as contagious disturbances because they occur at a spatial scale well below model resolution. Here we present a novel second-order spatially-implicit scheme for representing the size distribution of spatially contagious disturbances. We demonstrate a means for dynamically evolving spatial adjacency through time in response to disturbance. Our scheme shows that contagious disturbance types can be characterized as a function of their size and edge-to-interior ratio. This emergent disturbance characterization allows for description of disturbance across scales. This scheme lays the ground for a more realistic global-scale exploration of how spatially-complex disturbances interact with climate-change drivers, and forwards theoretical understanding of spatial and temporal evolution of disturbance.},

   abstract = {Plant diversity is an important driver of diversity at other trophic levels, suggesting that cascading extinctions could reduce overall biodiversity. Most evidence for positive effects of plant diversity comes from grasslands. Despite the fact that forests are hotspots of biodiversity, the importance of tree diversity, in particular its relative importance compared to other management related factors, in affecting forest-associated taxa is not well known. To address this, we used data from 183 plots, located in different forest types, from Mediterranean to Boreal, and established along a climatic gradient across six European countries (FunDivEUROPE project). We tested the influence of tree diversity, tree functional composition (i.e. functional trait values), forest structure, climate and soil on the diversity and abundance/activity of nine taxa (bats, birds, spiders, microorganisms, earthworms, ungulates, foliar fungal pathogens, defoliating insects and understorey plants) and on their overall diversity and abundance/activity (multidiversity, multiabundance/activity). Tree diversity was a key driver of taxon-level and overall forest-associated biodiversity, along with tree functional composition, forest structure, climate and soil. Both tree species richness and functional diversity (variation in functional trait values) were important. The effects of tree diversity on the abundance/activity of forest-associated taxa were less consistent. Nonetheless, spiders, ungulates and foliar fungal pathogens were all more abundant/active in diverse forests. Tree functional composition and structure were also important drivers of abundance/activity: conifer stands had lower overall multidiversity (although the effect was driven by defoliating insects), while stands with potentially tall trees had lower overall multiabundance/activity. We found more synergies than tradeoffs between diversity and abundance/activity of different taxa, suggesting that forest management can promote high diversity across taxa. Our results clearly show the high value of mixed forest stands for multiple forest-associated taxa and indicate that multiple dimensions of tree diversity (taxonomic and functional) are important.},

   abstract = {Forest vegetation management can improve planted seedling survival and growth and is thus widely used in plantation silviculture. In some jurisdictions, mechanical release using brushsaws has replaced the traditional use of chemical herbicides for forest vegetation management purposes. However, its associated costs and the increasing difficulty of finding qualified labor represent a challenge. The browsing of competition by large herbivores may represent an alternative to mechanical release when planted seedlings are resistant to browsing. Here, we compare the efficacy of moose browsing relative to mechanical release in controlling competing vegetation and in promoting white spruce growth in plantations. In a high moose density region, we used an experimental design consisting of four pairs of moose exclosures and unfenced plots; fifty percent of both the access-restricted and unrestricted study areas received a mechanical release treatment. Moose browsing was more efficient than mechanical release in diminishing the sapling density and basal area of competing species. Mechanical release only reduced the sapling density of taller competitors (height > 201 cm), whereas browsing reduced the sapling densities of competitors across a greater size range (height > 130 cm). These effects of moose browsing on competition translated into a greater positive effect of moose browsing on the basal area of planted spruces. We attribute the higher effectiveness of moose browsing relative to mechanical release to its chronic nature. Moose browsed continuously throughout the year and for multiple years, whereas mechanical release was applied only one time between the second and fourth years after planting. Our results suggest that pairing wildlife management and silviculture decisions could be in the best interest of both the hunting and forestry industries in regions where plantations are frequent and use browse-resistant crop trees. Favouring browsers in controlling the density of competing species could increase the hunting experience and income, while providing an effective, cost-free, and socially acceptable forest vegetation management service.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Deer pressure on forest regeneration constitutes a serious problem in commercial forests in the northern hemisphere due to the increase in deer populations. However, other drivers, such as climate, landscape structure and the level of human activity, have a strong influence on deer pressure. The direct, density-related impacts of ungulates on forest regeneration have been well studied, but there is limited empirical evidence related to the indirect factors mentioned above. We conducted a field experiment in three forest divisions in Poland to evaluate the role of a common element of human infrastructure, i.e. small, unpaved forestry roads. Additionally, we assessed the modifying effect of visibility driven by vegetation cover and forage availability. RESULTS: The proximity of unpaved roads affected deer habitat use and foraging behaviour, and limited browsing pressure on regenerating forests. Low visibility and higher winter forage availability increased the probability of tree browsing. We observed different responses to roads in two deer species: red deer avoided roads, while roe deer browsed in the vicinity of roads. CONCLUSIONS: A typical forest network of unpaved roads creates a landscape of fear for red and roe deer, and limits browsing pressure on regenerating forests due to the changes in deer habitat use, activity patterns and foraging behaviour. Knowledge of the factors influencing browsing pressure can help to spatially optimise the application of protective measures for tree seedlings.},

   abstract = {For temperate forests, Michigan, USA, we asked: (1) does evidence exist for a height-dependent sapling recruitment bottleneck caused by shrub layer competition and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) browsing and, if so, (2) how do these factors interact with light availability in shaping species-specific sapling recruitment niches? The combination of deer browsing effects on tree population height structure and the effects of deer and shrubs on tree seedling height and mortality indicate a shrub-deer bottleneck for sapling recruitment. The maximum height of deer browsing and shrub canopies as well as height dependent seedling mortality rates revealed a critical height threshold of approximately 2 m, above which trees escape from shrub and deer effects (i.e. sapling recruitment). Species’ sapling recruitment niches differed across a harvest gap size (i.e. light availability) gradient, over which tree seedling height growth potential and shrub competition increased with gap size, but deer browsing probability decreased. Specific to forests with high deer populations, niche differences were related to species growth and survival properties, with species generally falling into three groups: High Light, Broad, and Nowhere. High Light species incur high mortality from shade, shrub competition, and deer browsing. However, recruitment can occur in recently formed large gaps, where seedlings growing within developing shrub canopies avoid competition via rapid height growth and are partially protected from browsing deer. Broad species have lower mortality in shade and grow slower than High Light species and, compared to other groups, exhibit height growth and mortality rates that are less-sensitive to deer browsing pressure. These properties allows sapling recruitment of Broad species over a wide range of gap sizes, including larger gaps, where, via advance regeneration, they can avoid competition with developing shrub layers following canopy disturbance. Nowhere species are similar to Broad species, except their height growth and mortality are sensitive to deer browsing pressure. Heavy browsing pressure in smaller gaps and an inability to maintain taller advance regeneration to contend with shrub competition when large gaps form leave Nowhere species without a sapling recruitment niche. In conclusion, we provide evidence that shrub competition, ungulate browsing, harvest gap size and their interactions constrain height-specific sapling recruitment among tree species in the temperate forests of Michigan. Similar mechanisms may operate in other forests with high ungulate populations. Given these drivers and current management regimes, increasing tree species diversity and resilience to future disturbances may hinge on changing and integrating forest and ungulate management paradigms.},

We further studied interaction effects of four years (all year-round) grazing and Rubus cover on the presence, cover, and flowering of five forest ground flora species (unpalatable: Anemone nemorosa and Primula elatior; palatable: Hyacinthoides non-scripta, Vinca minor and Hedera helix). We collected data on eight transects and in 412 plots in adjacent grazed and ungrazed forest and used baseline datasets of 1996 and 2002 in the same area (i.e. before grazing). In a field experiment, we simulated grazing (by clipping) and trampling (by pressing a weight) in eight homogeneous A. nemorosa vegetation stands. Large Rubus thickets had a clear negative impact on cover and flowering of A. nemorosa due to competition for light. Four years of cattle grazing reduced bramble cover by more than 50%, but then the limiting factor for A. nemorosa cover and flowering shifted to trampling damage. We also found lower cover and flowering of H. non-scripta in grazed plots, as a consequence of direct grazing. The evergreen species V. minor and H. helix totally disappeared from the grazed forest. Simulated once-only effects of grazing and trampling had a small and short term negative impact on cover of A. nemorosa, but flowering was strongly reduced. Grazing reduced biomass with 25-30% in the following years. Year-round grazing with large herbivores is an appropriate measure for bramble control in forests, but negative effects on ground flora are possible if grazing pressure is high. A low or moderate grazing pressure (<0.25 animal units ha-1 y-1) should be maintained in landscape mosaics with grassland and forest; or intermittent periods of non-grazing should be provided to maintain forest ground flora diversity. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Therefore, we established three study areas in Connecticut to examine the interaction of three levels of invasive shrub control and absence or presence of deer herbivory on forest regeneration over 9 years. Five observations suggest that obtaining forest regeneration requires a comprehensive management strategy. First, competitive interference by invasive shrubs in intact thickets continued to impede forest regeneration, especially taller seedlings, after deer were excluded. Second, density of small seedlings increased following removal of the competitive interference by invasive shrubs. Third, deer browsing depressed growth of small seedlings into taller height classes. Fourth, preferential browsing reduced species richness, especially in taller seedling classes, by favoring growth of low palatability species such as beech. Lastly, if a disturbance (e.g., cutting) does not kill the root system of the invasive shrubs, the window of forest regeneration recruitment may be narrow because invasive shrubs can quickly recover. In stands with both established shrub thickets and high deer densities, invasive shrub control and multiyear reduction of deer densities are both recommended to obtain adequate forest regeneration.},

   abstract = {Changes in the efficiency of light interception and in the costs for light harvesting along the light gradients from the top of the plant canopy to the bottom are the major means by which efficient light harvesting is achieved in ecosystems. In the current review analysis, leaf, shoot and canopy level determinants of plant light harvesting, the light-driven plasticity in key traits altering light harvesting, and variations among different plant functional types and between species of different shade tolerance are analyzed. In addition, plant age- and size-dependent alterations in light harvesting efficiency are also examined. At the leaf level, the variations in light harvesting are driven by alterations in leaf chlorophyll content modifies the fraction of incident light harvested by given leaf area, and in leaf dry mass per unit area (MA) that determines the amount of leaf area formed with certain fraction of plant biomass in the leaves. In needle-leaved species with complex foliage cross-section, the degree of foliage surface exposure also depends on the leaf total-to-projected surface area ratio. At the shoot scale, foliage inclination angle distribution and foliage spatial aggregation are the major determinants of light harvesting, while at the canopy scale, branching frequency, foliage distribution and biomass allocation to leaves (FL) modify light harvesting significantly. FL decreases with increasing plant size from herbs to shrubs to trees due to progressively larger support costs in plant functional types with greater stature. Among trees, FL and stand leaf area index scale positively with foliage longevity. Plant traits altering light harvesting have a large potential to adjust to light availability. Chlorophyll per mass increases, while MA, foliage inclination from the horizontal and degree of spatial aggregation decrease with decreasing light availability. In addition, branching frequency decreases and canopies become flatter in lower light. All these plastic modifications greatly enhance light harvesting in low light. Species with greater shade tolerance typically form a more extensive canopy by having lower MA in deciduous species and enhanced leaf longevity in evergreens. In addition, young plants of shade tolerators commonly have less strongly aggregated foliage and flatter canopies, while in adult plants partly exposed to high light, higher shade tolerance of foliage allows the shade tolerators to maintain more leaf layers, resulting in extended crowns. Within a given plant functional type, increases in plant age and size result in increases in MA, reductions in FL and increases in foliage aggregation, thereby reducing plant leaf area index and the efficiency of light harvesting. Such dynamic modifications in plant light harvesting play a key role in stand development and productivity. Overall, the current review analysis demonstrates that a suite of chemical and architectural traits at various scales and their plasticity drive plant light harvesting efficiency. Enhanced light harvesting can be achieved by various combinations of traits, and these suites of traits vary during plant ontogeny. © 2010 The Ecological Society of Japan.},

   abstract = {As global terrestrial biodiversity declines via land-use change, society has placed increasing value on non-commercial species as providers of ecosystem services. Yet, many deer species and non-crop plants are perceived negatively when they decrease crop productivity, leading to reduced economic gains and human-wildlife conflict. We hypothesized that deer provide an ecosystem service in forest plantations by controlling competition and promoting crop-tree growth, although the effects of herbivory may depend on forest management intensity. If management negatively affects foraging habitat at local and landscape scales, then we expected browsing to shift to less nutritious crop trees. To test these hypotheses, we established a 5-year experiment that manipulated early forest management intensity via herbicide treatments and access of two deer species to vegetation via exclosures. Contrary to our hypothesis, deer provided an ecosystem service at high management intensities and a disservice occurred with low-intensity management. Crop-tree growth and survival was greatest when herbivory and herbicides suppressed broadleaf regeneration. In contrast, crop-tree growth was lowest when broadleaf vegetation was retained and crop trees were subject to both browse damage and competition. We found a positive, yet variable, association between deer detections and stand – and landscape-scale broadleaf habitat, and despite initial reductions in forage, herbivory pressure was similar among management intensities. When broadleaf vegetation was suppressed by herbicides and herbivory, selection of herbaceous forage by deer intensified, likely aiding in the service. Overall, our findings indicate that the effects of vegetation management for promoting timber production are highly dependent on the presence of large herbivores. Synthesis and applications. Although deer are thought to reduce crop productivity in many systems, we found that herbivory switched from reducing crop-tree growth where non-crop vegetation was retained, to promoting crop-tree growth when both herbivory and herbicides suppressed competing vegetation. However, the provision of this ecosystem service is likely contingent on the amount of forage available in the landscape and subsequent foraging pressure. We conclude that nature's capacity to provide ecosystem services depends on the intensity of management at local and landscape scales.},

   abstract = {The moose (Alces alces) is a dominant large mammalian herbivore in the world's boreal zones. Moose exert significant browsing impacts on forest vegetation and are therefore often at the centre of wildlife-forestry conflicts. Consequently, understanding the drivers of their foraging behaviour is crucial for mitigating such conflicts. Management of moose in large parts of its range currently largely ignores the fact that moose foraging is influenced by increasing populations of sympatric deer species. In such multispecies systems, resource partitioning may be driven by foraging height and bite size. Feeding competition with smaller species might replace larger species from the field layer and drive them towards higher foraging strata offering larger bites. This bite size hypothesis has been well documented for African ungulate communities. Based on a large diet DNA metabarcoding dataset we suggest that feeding competition from three smaller deer species (red deer Cervus elaphus, fallow deer Dama dama, and roe deer Capreolus capreolus) over Vaccinium shrubs in the forest field layer might drive moose towards increasing consumption of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in Sweden. We found that in areas of high deer density, moose diets consistently contained less Vaccinium and higher proportions of pine over three spring periods. Utilization of these food items by the smaller deer species was either unaffected by deer density or, for Vaccinium showed the opposite pattern to moose, i.e., increases of proportions in the diet of roe and red deer with increasing deer density. Availability of pine and Vaccinium, measured as proportion of available bites, did not explain the observed patterns. Our results suggest that managing key food items like Vaccinium and the populations of smaller deer may play an important role in controlling browsing impacts of moose on pine.},

   abstract = {Increasing frequency of extreme climate events is likely to impose increased stress on ecosystems and to jeopardize the services that ecosystems provide. Therefore, it is of major importance to assess the effects of extreme climate events on the temporal stability (i.e., the resistance, the resilience, and the variance) of ecosystem properties. Most time series of ecosystem properties are, however, affected by varying data characteristics, uncertainties, and noise, which complicate the comparison of ecosystem stability metrics (ESMs) between locations. Therefore, there is a strong need for a more comprehensive understanding regarding the reliability of stability metrics and how they can be used to compare ecosystem stability globally. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of temporal ESMs based on time series of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index of 15 global land-cover types. We provide a framework (i) to assess the reliability of ESMs in function of data characteristics, uncertainties and noise and (ii) to integrate reliability estimates in future global ecosystem stability studies against climate disturbances. The performance of our framework was tested through (i) a global ecosystem comparison and (ii) an comparison of ecosystem stability in response to the 2003 drought. The results show the influence of data quality on the accuracy of ecosystem stability. White noise, biased noise, and trends have a stronger effect on the accuracy of stability metrics than the length of the time series, temporal resolution, or amount of missing values. Moreover, we demonstrate the importance of integrating reliability estimates to interpret stability metrics within confidence limits. Based on these confidence limits, other studies dealing with specific ecosystem types or locations can be put into context, and a more reliable assessment of ecosystem stability against environmental disturbances can be obtained. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

   abstract = {There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem processes in changing environments, but the mechanisms that underlie this effect are still controversial and poorly understood. Here, we extend mechanistic theory of ecosystem stability in competitive communities to clarify the mechanisms underlying diversity-stability relationships. We first explain why, contrary to a widely held belief, interspecific competition should generally play a destabilising role. We then explore the stabilising effect of differences in species' intrinsic rates of natural increase and provide a synthesis of various potentially stabilising mechanisms. Three main mechanisms are likely to operate in the stabilising effects of biodiversity on ecosystem properties: (1) asynchrony of species' intrinsic responses to environmental fluctuations, (2) differences in the speed at which species respond to perturbations, (3) reduction in the strength of competition. The first two mechanisms involve temporal complementarity between species, while the third results from functional complementarity. Additional potential mechanisms include selection effects, behavioural changes resulting from species interactions and mechanisms arising from trophic or non-trophic interactions and spatial heterogeneity. We conclude that mechanistic trait-based approaches are key to predicting the effects of diversity on ecosystem stability and to bringing the old diversity-stability debate to a final resolution. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS.},

We quantitatively synthesized data from these studies to produce generalities about the effects of a broad array of environmental changes on herbivores. Since conversion of natural habitat to agriculture has been one of the most profound environmental changes over the past century, the effects of global change variables on plant defense were also compared between natural and agricultural systems. We found evidence that increasing CO2, light availability, and nutrients all consistently increase herbivory, particularly by generalists. No significant differences in chemistry and herbivory response variables were found between natural and managed systems.

Keystone species play disproportionately large, important roles in their ecosystems, but human-wildlife conflicts often drive population declines. Population declines have resulted in the necessity of keystone species reintroduction; however, studies of such reintroductions are rare. We conducted a literature review and found only 30 peer-reviewed journal articles that assessed reintroduced populations of keystone species, and only 11 of these assessed ecosystem-level effects following reintroduction. Nine of 11 publications assessing ecosystem-level effects found evidence of resumption of keystone roles; however, these publications focus on a narrow range of species. We highlight the deficit of peer-reviewed literature on keystone species reintroductions, and draw attention to the need for assessment of ecosystem-level effects so that the presence, extent, and rate of ecosystem restoration driven by keystone species can be better understood.},

   abstract = {Although trophic cascades - the effect of apex predators on progressively lower trophic level species through top-down forcing - have been demonstrated in diverse ecosystems, the broader potential influences of trophic cascades on other species and ecosystem processes are not well studied. We used the overexploitation, recovery and subsequent collapse of sea otter (Enhydra lutris) populations in the Aleutian archipelago to explore if and how the abundance and diet of kelp forest fishes are influenced by a trophic cascade linking sea otters with sea urchins and fleshy macroalgae. We measured the abundance of sea urchins (biomass density), kelp (numerical density) and fish (Catch per unit effort) at four islands in the mid-1980s (when otters were abundant at two of the islands and rare at the two others) and in 2000 (after otters had become rare at all four islands). Our fish studies focused on rock greenling (Hexagrammos lagocephalus), the numerically dominant species in this region. In the mid-1980s, the two islands with high-density otter populations supported dense kelp forests, relatively few urchins, and abundant rock greenling whereas the opposite pattern (abundant urchins, sparse kelp forests, and relatively few rock greenling) occurred at islands where otters were rare. In the 2000, the abundances of urchins, kelp and greenling were grossly unchanged at islands where otters were initially rare but had shifted to the characteristic pattern of otter-free systems at islands where otters were initially abundant. Significant changes in greenling diet occurred between the mid-1980s and the 2000 although the reasons for these changes were difficult to assess because of strong island-specific effects. Whereas urchin-dominated communities supported more diverse fish assemblages than kelp-dominated communities, this was not a simple effect of the otter-induced trophic cascade because all islands supported more diverse fish assemblages in 2000 than in the mid-1980s. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

   abstract = {Recent research has generally shown that a small change in the number of species in a food web can have consequences both for community structure and ecosystem processes. However 'change' is not limited to just the number of species in a community, but might include an alteration to such properties as precipitation, nutrient cycling and temperature, all of which are correlated with productivity. Here we argue that predicted scenarios of global change will result in increased plant productivity. We model three scenarios of change using simple Lotka-Volterra dynamics, which explore how a global change in productivity might affect the strength of local species interactions and detail the consequences for community and ecosystem level stability. Our results indicate that (i) at local scales the average population size of consumers may decline because of poor quality food resources, (ii) that the strength of species interactions at equilibrium may become weaker because of reduced population size, and (iii) that species populations may become more variable and may take longer to recover from environmental or anthropogenic disturbances. At local scales interaction strengths encompass such properties as feeding rates and assimilation efficiencies, and encapsulate functionally important information with regard to ecosystem processes. Interaction strengths represent the pathways and transfer of energy through an ecosystem. We examine how such local patterns might be affected given various scenarios of 'global change' and discuss the consequences for community stability and ecosystem functioning. © 2004 Elsevier GmbH.

   abstract = {Climate change is expected to have significant and complex impacts on ecological communities. In addition to direct effects of climate on species, there can also be indirect effects through an intermediary species, such as in host–plant interactions. Indirect effects are expected to be more pronounced in alpine environments because these ecosystems are sensitive to temperature changes and there are limited areas for migration of both species (i.e. closed systems), and because of simpler trophic interactions. We tested the hypothesis that climate change will reduce the range of an alpine butterfly (Parnassius smintheus) because of indirect effects through its host plant (Sedum sp.). To test for direct and indirect effects, we used the simulations of climate change to assess the distribution of P. smintheus with and without Sedum sp. We also compared the projected ranges of P. smintheus to four other butterfly species that are found in the alpine, but that are generalists feeding on many plant genera. We found that P. smintheus gained distributional area in climate-only models, but these gains were significantly reduced with the inclusion of Sedum sp. and in dry-climate scenarios which resulted in a reduction in net area. When compared to the more generalist butterfly species, P. smintheus exhibited the largest loss in suitable habitat. Our findings support the importance of including indirect effects in modelling species distributions in response to climate change. We highlight the potentially large and still neglected impacts climate change can have on the trophic structure of communities, which can lead to significant losses of biodiversity. In the future, communities will continue to favour species that are generalists as climate change induces asynchronies in the migration of species.},

   abstract = {Across the biosphere, rapid and accelerating changes in land use, climate and atmospheric composition driven primarily by anthropogenic forces are known to exert major influences on the productivity, biodiversity and sustainable provision of ecosystem goods and services. Thus far, many studies assessing the ecological consequences of global change have focussed on single trophic levels. However, understanding these changes and predicting their consequences may benefit from unravelling how interactions between primary producers, primary, and secondary consumers (plants, herbivores and carnivores) are being affected. Conservation and restoration may be improved when assessing species and their interactions on appropriate scales, while acknowledging that above- and belowground biota are ecologically linked. Selection pressures on one species may depend on others, so that species loss means more for diversity than just loss of a single taxon. It may also result in the loss of other species of the same or different trophic levels and in the dilution, or even loss, of various selection pressures. We review a number of discussions on trophic interactions in a changing world in relation to (i) the scale of ecosystem response to environmental change with emphasis on the soil subsystem, (ii) the linkage of above- and belowground subsystems and (iii) natural selection and the stability of community structure and ecosystem functioning. We discuss the need to bring together isolated sub-disciplines of ecology in order to understand the implications of global changes for ecosystem processes. © 2004 Elsevier GmbH.

Their effects operate via a variety of generalizable mechanisms related to plant palatability and relative growth rate with respect to browsing pressure. Though such impacts are obviously long-lasting when they determine composition of tree regeneration, we document in a unique long-term (30 year) experiment that biological legacies of initial deer density persist in the understorey herbaceous vegetation at least 20 years after deer densities were equalized. We sampled understorey vegetation in former clear-cut areas where density of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) was manipulated (3.9-31.2 deer km-2) for 10 years (1979-1990), and stands experienced ambient deer density (ca. 10-12 deer km-2) for the next 20 years (1990-2010) to determine whether initial deer density treatments still influenced understorey vegetation in 30-year-old, closed-canopy forests. Stands initially (1979-1990) exposed to higher deer densities had ca. five times higher fern cover and three times the seedling and forb cover in 2010, as well as significantly lower angiosperm species density, compared to stands initially exposed to lower deer densities. These results appear driven by deer avoidance of ferns, allowing them to expand at high deer density and sequester sites for decades. Synthesis. Our long-term, experimental results show unequivocally that elevated deer densities cause significant, profound legacy effects on understorey vegetation persisting at least 20 years. Of relevance regionally and globally where high deer densities have created depauperate understoreys, we expect that deer density reduction alone does not guarantee understorey recovery; stands may need to be managed by removing recalcitrant understorey layers (e.g. ferns).

Although many of the reviewed studies reported an increase in the intensity of high-impact wind speed and extreme cyclone frequency in the second half of the 21st century, the projections of aspects of future storminess over the NAER differed regionally. There is broad consensus that the frequency and intensity of storms, cyclones, and high-impact wind speed will increase over Central and Western Europe, and these changes will probably have the potential to produce more damage. In contrast, future extratropical storminess over Southern Europe is very likely to decrease. For Northern and Eastern Europe the results of the evaluation are inconclusive, because there is an indication of increasing as well as decreasing development of the evaluated aspects of future storminess. Concerning the storm track, we found indications of a likely north- and eastward shift in most assessed studies.

However, disentangling the effects of climate change on the temporal increase in tree mortality from those of management and forest dynamics remains a challenge. Using a modelling approach taking tree and stand characteristics into account, we sought to evaluate the impact of climate change on background mortality for the most common European tree species. We focused on background mortality, which is the mortality observed in a stand in the absence of abrupt disturbances, to avoid confusion with mortality events unrelated to long-term changes in temperature and rainfall. We studied 372 974 trees including 7312 dead trees from forest inventory data surveyed across France between 2009 and 2015. Factors related to competition, stand characteristics, management intensity, and site conditions were the expected preponderant drivers of mortality. Taking these main drivers into account, we detected a climate change signal on 45% of the 43 studied species, explaining an average 6% of the total modelled mortality. For 18 out of the 19 species sensitive to climate change, we evidenced greater mortality with increasing temperature or decreasing rainfall. By quantifying the mortality excess linked to the current climate change for European temperate forest tree species, we provide new insights into forest vulnerability that will prove useful for adapting forest management to future conditions.},

   abstract = {Species distribution models predict a wholesale redistribution of trees in the next century, yet migratory responses necessary to spatially track climates far exceed maximum post-glacial rates. The extent to which populations will adapt will depend upon phenotypic variation, strength of selection, fecundity, inter- specific competition, and biotic interactions. Populations of temperate and bor- eal trees show moderate to strong clines in phenology and growth along temperature gradients, indicating substantial local adaptation. Traits involved in local adaptation appear to be the product of small effects of many genes, and the resulting genotypic redundancy combined with high fecundity may facilitate rapid local adaptation despite high gene flow. Gene flow with pre- adapted alleles from warmer climates may promote adaptation and migration at the leading edge, while populations at the rear will likely face extirpation. Widespread species with large populations and high fecundity are likely to per- sist and adapt, but will likely suffer adaptational lag for a few generations. As all tree species will be suffering lags, interspecific competition may weaken, facilitating persistence under suboptimal conditions. Species with small popula- tions, fragmented ranges, low fecundity, or suffering declines due to introduced insects or diseases should be candidates for facilitated migration. Introduction},

   abstract = {White-tailed deer have increased in abundance and expanded their geographic range in North America over the past century, and now exist at higher densities than they have in the past several hundred years. This is having numerous impacts on the forest ecosystems they inhabit. Regional recruitment failure of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) and northern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis) trees can be explained in part by deer browsing. Deer also have significant negative effects on understorey plants, including wild lily-of-the-valley (Maianthemum canadense) and white-flowered trillium (Trillium grandiflorum). Long-term studies of primary, old-growth forest stands reveal a 48-81 per cent herb and shrub species loss accompanying increases in deer density. Graminoids, ferns and club mosses were more likely to persist in these stands than plants in all other taxonomic groups. Deer also exhibit indirect effects on forest communities by reducing host plant densities or altering forest structure. Because of their numerous direct and indirect effects on other species, and because of the magnitude of these effects, white-tailed deer act as a keystone herbivore. Natural regulation and maximum sustained yield management approaches have failed to alleviate deer impacts on forest ecosystems, but an ecosystem-based management approach offers promise.},

   abstract = {Big game populations have been rapidly increasing in temperate and boreal ecosystems worldwide, which has prompted the need to study the socio-ecological issues related to their management. In addition, the use of game-fencing has been spreading in certain rural areas, especially in French Sologne. These two parallel trends raise the issue of the new socio-spatial arrangements developing in rural areas. We set up an in-depth case-study combining stakeholder-interviews and ecological surveys (red deer trails, pellets and bed sites) to understand how game fences may affect both animal and human mobility, and why this may raise human conflicts. The study site was a 17.52 km² fenced landscape comprising a public forest bordered on the north and south by two privately owned fenced lots. Both the interviews and the ecological data indicated that the fences were crossable for red deer. We did not find any fencing effect on the location of red deer trails, though red deer pellet groups were significantly more frequent outside fenced lots. On the other hand, we recorded more bed sites within fenced lots, in accordance with the stakeholders’ statements that fenced lots had a high sheltering value for red deer. This implies that stakeholders have contrasting opportunities to encounter red deer because the fences deter non-owners from trespassing. Although any private owner has the legal right to fence his or her land under French law, our finding calls for more attention to how the fencing is designed, since its effects may impact the surrounding landscape. For instance, fences can allow a single owner to impose game management policies in the areas surrounding his or her estate.},

Ungulates may negatively affect understory-dependent woodland birds either directly or indirectly. For instance ungulates may prey on nests, or they may reduce the availability of nesting sites, foraging resources or cover for understory-dependent bird species. We conducted ungulate pressure, vegetation and bird surveys on 95 plots, in 19 mature forest stands (9 fenced and 10 unfenced properties) located in the Sologne region (France). In such private forests, ungulate population densities are highly variable; we were therefore able to explore the effects of varying red deer (Cervus elaphus) browsing and wild boar (Sus scrofa) rooting intensity on bird communities. Bayesian Binomial mixture models indicated that ground-nesting birds were more abundant in forests with high observed wild boar rooting intensity. Generally, increasing deer browsing pressure did not have any negative effect on woodland birds in mature forest stands with a developed canopy, and did not result in lower shrub cover. Most previous studies documenting a negative effect of browsing on birds focused on young forest stands where overstory vegetation was scarce. Our results suggest that the impact of ungulate pressure on forest birds may decrease with forest stand age.},

   abstract = {The North-American Northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.) introduced to European forests over 200 years ago, spreads spontaneously in various types of forest ecosystems. At the same time the retreat of native pedunculate oak (Q. robur L.) has been observed. We aimed to recognize the extent of natural regeneration and recruitment of pedunculate (PO) and red oak (RO) in managed forests (central Poland) on sites typical of oak-pine mixed forest, as well as to identify habitat conditions which favour the occurrence of native oak and spread of the alien oak. The abundance and heights of juveniles of both oaks, as well as the impacts of the canopy, nurse and burial effects, on distribution and occurrence of oak specimens were studied on 1000 study plots (1 m2 each), in two transects crossing the Scots pine-pedunculate oak forest (POF) and the Scots pine-northern red oak forest (ROF). We revealed an advantage of introduced RO over native PO in natural regeneration, recruitment and spread. However, we did not find direct (interspecific) competition between PO and RO recruits. RO predominance over PO resulted from more effective colonization of empty niches by the alien oak in POF (suitable for both species), and the abundant establishment of RO seedlings and saplings within ROF. In contrast, PO was not able to re-colonize ROF. The regeneration of RO was microsite-limited in ROF gaps in the regeneration phase (probably due to site moisture deficiency) and under closed RO canopy in the recruitment phase (due to low light availability), and microsite-favoured under mature tree crowns due to the burial effect of the litter layer (and higher light availability under heterogeneous canopy). In POF, RO regeneration was microsite-favoured due to the burial effect of a dense moss layer and the nurse effect of shrubs, including conspecifics. PO regeneration was also microsite-favoured due to the burial effect of the moss layer, but its recruitment was herbivore-limited there (due to browsing). The co-occurrence of PO and RO specimens, both in POF and ROF, resulted from forest community structure, oak ecology and behaviour of acorn dispersers. Because the native PO is at a disadvantage in its native range caused by a lower share of mature trees in forested areas, strong impacts of fungal pathogens and high pressure by insects and large herbivores (also noted in our study), the introduced oak is able to become a serious competitor.},

   abstract = {Background: Within the framework of close-to-nature forestry, oak forest (Quercus robur, Q. petraea) regeneration techniques that consider both silvicultural and nature conservation demands have become a very important issue. While there are many experimental and local studies that aim at disentangling the relationships between different environmental and silvicultural factors and the success of oak regeneration, systematic supra-regional studies at the greater landscape level are missing so far. Against this background, the first objective (a) of this study was to present an efficient and sufficiently accurate sampling scheme for supra-regional forest regrowth inventories, which we applied to young oaks stands. The second, and major, objective (b) was to identify the crucial success factors for high-quality oak forest regeneration in northwest Germany. Results: Objective (a): Factors that have been identified as potentially crucial for the success or failure of oak regeneration were either included in a field inventory procedure or extracted from forest inventory databases. We found that the collected data were suitable to be analyzed in a three-step success model, which was aimed at identifying the crucial success factors for high-quality oak forest regeneration. Objective (b): Our modeling procedure, which included a Bayesian estimation approach with spike-and-slab priors, revealed that competitive pressure from the secondary tree species was the most decisive success factor; no competition, or low competition by secondary tree species appeared to be particularly beneficial for the success of high-quality oak regeneration. Also fencing and the absence of competitive vegetation (weeds, grass, bracken) seemed to be beneficial factors for the success of oak regeneration. Conclusions: Trusting in biological automation was found to be mostly useless regarding economically viable oak forest regeneration. To efficiently organize oak regeneration planning and silvicultural decision-making within a forest enterprise, it is strongly recommended to initially evaluate the annual financial and personnel capacities for carrying out young growth tending or pre-commercial thinning and only then to decide on the extent of regenerated oak stands. Careful and adaptive regeneration planning is also indispensable to secure the long-term ecological continuity in oak forests. Oak regeneration should therefore preferably take place within the close vicinity of old oak stands or directly in them. The retention of habitat trees is urgently advised.},

The experiment was established on a clearcut and an adjacent oak shelterwood in southern Sweden. In the experiment, a total of 6 840 acorns were sown. The sowing was carried out with different vegetation control and soil preparation treatments and with different planting depths. The germination percentage was highest for acorns sown at five cm depth and lowest for acorns sown on top of the soil, and lower for acoms sown in areas where the humus layer had been removed than in areas where the humus layer was retained. There was no difference in the percentage germination after two growing seasons between acorns sown inside the shelterwood and acorns sown on the clearcut. The height of the seedlings was lowest when the humus was removed while the number of leaves per seedling was lowest for seedlings in untreated areas after two growing seasons. Furthermore, seedlings in untreated areas showed the lowest relative height growth rate during the second growing season. In spite of higher biomass of ground vegetation in undisturbed areas compared to treated areas, no effect of the soil and vegetation control treatments could be found on soil water potentials. The soil temperature and photosynthetic active radiation at seedling level were higher in areas where soil preparation and vegetation control had been performed. However, it was concluded that neither low soil water availability nor low light levels could be the only cause of lower relative height growth rate during the second growing season for seedlings in undisturbed areas. © 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

The diameter, length and mass of acorns were measured before and after scarification in four batches of acorns harvested from uneven-aged trees (76, 91, 131 and 161 years). The measured parameters were used to determine the correlations between acorn dimensions and mass, and to calculate the dimensional scarification index and the mass scarification index in acorns. Individual complete and scarified acorns from every batch were germinated on sand and peat substrate for 28 days. The analyzed acorns were characterized by average size and mass. Scarification decreased acorn mass by around 22% and acorn length by around 31% on average. Scarification and the elimination of infected acorns increased germination capacity from around 64% to around 81% on average. Acorns can be divided into size groups before scarification to obtain seed material with varied germination capacity. Larger acorns with higher germination capacity can be used for sowing in container nurseries, whereas smaller acorns with lower germination capacity can be sown in open-field nurseries.},

Flooding delayed the germination of submerged acorns till the end of inundation. However, seeds of the flooding treatments had significantly higher germination rates than the non-flooded acorns of the control. Likewise, dry weights of seedlings from the flooded seeds were significantly higher than those of seedlings from seeds not flooded. Aboveground growth in the 24-week growth period following flooding was reduced in favour of root development in either trial of the experiment. Restricted leaf development and reduced shoot elongation stalled the growth of young oaks in the seedling trial. The results confirm knowledge from earlier experiments about the flood tolerance of Quercus robur seed and seedlings. They also serve to explain why oak seedlings are widespread on the Rhine floodplain after mast years, but gradually disappear in successive years.},

In this laboratory study, the use of four seed treatments to potentially reduce bank vole (Myodes glareolus) consumption of beech nuts and acorns and a control was evaluated using a no-choice feeding set-up. The five seed treatments were: Chili (Capsicum chinense)/coconut fat, citronella (Cymbopogon winterianus)/rapeseed oils, mink (Mustela vision) excrement, sand coating as a physical barrier and a control. Seed germination tests were carried out with all the treatments. A total of 40 bank voles were individually given access to beech nuts or acorns at a rate of one treatment per day during two sessions. Mink excrement and chili/coconut fat treatments greatly reduced the consumption of beech nuts, and also reduced touching of beech nuts and acorns. In contrast, the sand coating treatment increased the consumption of both types of seeds. Germination of both beech nuts and acorns was reduced by the chilli/coconut fat and citronella/rapeseed oils treatments. Our results suggest that mink excrement has a potential as an effective repellent against bank voles when direct seeding is applied. However, further studies to determine the best method of application, as well as the efficiency under field conditions, are needed before definitive recommendations can be given to restoration managers.},

   abstract = {Restoration of mixed oak forest in northern temperate regions is important for biodiversity and for adaptation of forest management to climate change. Direct seeding has been considered as a cost-effective method for the assisted regeneration of oaks. However, removal of acorns by granivorous rodents hinders its application. Patterns of acorn removal can vary with habitat type, presence of predators, and acorn size. In this field study, we tested the effects of distance to forest edge, predator excrement as a repellent, and acorn size on the performance of direct-seeded oak in southern Sweden. The experiment was carried out at two different sites. Our hypotheses were: (i) in clear-cuts, acorn removal is higher closer to the forest edge compared to open areas, (ii) treatment with predator excrement reduces acorn removal without affecting germination, and (iii) larger acorns will be removed more readily than smaller acorns. Finally, we also investigated if seedlings from larger acorns survive better and grow taller compared to smaller acorns in relation to habitat structure and predator excrement as repellent. Acorn removal differed at the two sites. At Skrylle (older clear-cut), no forest edge effects were found. At Klåveröd (new clear-cut site), our results suggest that removal of acorns was higher in the open clear-cut due to the presence of large slash piles. Less vegetation coverage correlated with lower rates of acorn removal, except near slash piles. Our results therefore suggest that forest managers should reduce understory vegetation and avoid slash piles during direct seeding of oak. Mink excrement failed to protect acorns against removal, but did not reduce acorn germination. Bigger acorns produced taller seedlings but did not enhance overall woodland establishment due to their higher removal rate. Our results further suggest a potential food satiation effect due to an extra supply of additional food. Satiation manipulation might potentially be a method of mitigating the impact of seed predation by granivorous rodents during the direct seeding of oak, but such an approach requires further research before it could be recommended.},

   abstract = {The scale of opportunity to implement forest restoration exceeds billions of ha worldwide, and a part of this area in northern temperate regions includes formerly oak (Quercus spp.)-dominated ecosystems. The cost of achieving restoration is often high, and tends to increase with severity of ecosystem degradation. Therefore, it is important to develop cost-efficient regeneration practices to support forest restoration. Direct seeding of acorns, one of the earliest artificial forest regeneration techniques developed, offers several benefits including costs that can be about a third of planting oak seedlings. However, direct seeding is presently a more uncertain practice for establishing oak forests and woodlands than is planting seedlings. Much of this uncertainty can be a result of acorn depredation by rodents even though other factors may also limit oak establishment. This review provides a synthesis of foundational knowledge, particularly from Europe and North America, pertaining to the biology and ecology of acorn production, acorn germination, early seedling growth, and acorn depredation by granivorous rodents. We build on this knowledge to review research on operational direct seeding practices and four basic strategies for acorn depredation control (chemical, ecological, physical and silvicultural). We suggest that environmentally sound approaches to minimize acorn depredation and increase seedling establishment currently exists. For example, seeding operations probably hold higher chances for success if scheduled during years of high masting, if applied on open sites (areas with little shrub and tree cover), and if acorn lots are sized and sown at an appropriate depth. Several gaps in our knowledge limit the development of improved operational practices for broader success. We lack information on basic acorn biology and proper handling and storage practices for many of the oaks around the world. And, we need research to support development of new techniques or combinations of strategies and techniques that minimize acorn depredation under a wide range of site conditions. Nevertheless, our synthesis suggests that direct seeding will remain a cost-effective and environmentally sound practice for oak forest and woodland establishment, and it will likely gain expanded use as future research informs innovation that increases seed availability, decreases acorn depredation, and raises predictability of oak seedling establishment.},

Do plant species naturally fall into distinct groups corresponding to masting and nonmasting habits? Do plant populations generally exhibit significant bimodality in annual seed output? Are there significant relationships between annual variability in seed production and pollination and seed dispersal modes, as predicted from economy of scale considerations? We failed to identify distinct groups of species with contrasting levels of annual variability in seed output but did find evidence that most polycarpic woody plants seem to adhere to alternating supra-annual schedules consisting of either high or low reproduction years. Seed production was weakly more variable among wind-pollinated taxa than animal-pollinated ones. Plants dispersed by mutualistic frugivores were less variable than those dispersed by either inanimate means or animals that predominantly behave as seed predators. We conclude that there are no objective reasons to perpetuate the concept of mast fruiting in the ecological literature as a shorthand to designate a distinct biological phenomenon.

   abstract = {To understand ecological phenomena, it is necessary to observe their behaviour across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Since this need was first highlighted in the 1980s, technology has opened previously inaccessible scales to observation. To help to determine whether there have been corresponding changes in the scales observed by modern ecologists, we analysed the resolution, extent, interval and duration of observations (excluding experiments) in 348 studies that have been published between 2004 and 2014. We found that observational scales were generally narrow, because ecologists still primarily use conventional field techniques. In the spatial domain, most observations had resolutions ≤1 m2 and extents ≤10,000 ha. In the temporal domain, most observations were either unreplicated or infrequently repeated (>1 month interval) and ≤1 year in duration. Compared with studies conducted before 2004, observational durations and resolutions appear largely unchanged, but intervals have become finer and extents larger. We also found a large gulf between the scales at which phenomena are actually observed and the scales those observations ostensibly represent, raising concerns about observational comprehensiveness. Furthermore, most studies did not clearly report scale, suggesting that it remains a minor concern. Ecologists can better understand the scales represented by observations by incorporating autocorrelation measures, while journals can promote attentiveness to scale by implementing scale-reporting standards.},

   abstract = {Summary: Large mammalian herbivores are major drivers of the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystems world-wide, and changes in their abundance have resulted in many populations being actively managed. Many empirical studies have identified that abundant mammalian herbivores can have negative impacts on biodiversity, but there has been no specific review of the impacts of native mammalian herbivores. We assessed the peer-reviewed literature on the effects of large native herbivores on other animals. We aimed to quantitatively synthesize current knowledge, identify gaps and limitations in the literature, and highlight priorities for future research. Most empirical studies of herbivory effects compared only two levels of herbivory (76%), and meta-analysis showed that very high densities of herbivores, when compared with very low densities, had mostly negative effects on other animal species. These negative effects were usually attributed to changes in the quantity and/or structure of vegetation. Only 24% of papers studied animal responses across a gradient of herbivore densities, and nonlinear responses to herbivory, as well as responses to low and moderate herbivore densities, remain poorly understood. The literature also was dominated by short-term studies (76% sampled animal responses for 2 years or less), and there was a high incidence of confounding factors among studies (38% of studies). In addition, many studies used only coarse metrics to assess effects (e.g. only 33% of studies assessed species composition) and few included community-level synthesis (only 31% of studies reported results from more than one animal class). Synthesis and applications. Critical questions remain for both basic ecology and the management of large native herbivores for biodiversity. Key knowledge gaps include (i) nonlinear responses to herbivore pressure, (ii) how responses differ between different herbivores, (iii) the spatial and (iv) the temporal variation of responses, (v) how the effects of herbivores interact with other land management activities and (vi) the mechanisms driving cascading effects through ecosystems. We identify ways to address these gaps and emphasize the need for studies which employ contrasts over a gradient of ecologically relevant herbivore densities and biologically meaningful time frames. © 2014 British Ecological Society.},

   abstract = {Recent studies have shown that an increase in the population size of sika deer (Cervus nippon) decreases the abundance of rodents but increases that of several invertebrates (Scarabaeidae, Rhaphidophoridae, and earthworms) outside a deep-proof fence in Oku-Nikko, Japan. Therefore, the diet of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) feeding on these animals is expected to vary according to changes in prey abundance. As red foxes also scavenge deer carcasses, an increase in the number of deer is expected to lead to changes in the red fox diet. In this study, the diet and sightings of red foxes inside and outside the fence were compared. Generalized linear mixed models indicate that the sika deer remains, ground-dwelling insects (Scarabaeidae and Rhaphidophoridae as a group, and Carabidae), and earthworms increased in the fox diet outside the fence, while the ingestion of voles decreased. The difference in prey consumption by red foxes was probably caused by differences in prey availability inside and outside the fence or the presence of available alternative food. These results suggest that red foxes demonstrate dietary plasticity in areas where habitat structure has been substantially modified by deer grazing. Although the abundance of voles, the primary food of red foxes, decreased outside the fence, the sighting rates of red foxes obtained by spotlight count were not significantly different between inside and outside the fence, suggesting that the presence of the others increased or available alternative food may have compensated for the negative effects of decreasing vole abundance.},

   abstract = {Even though mammalian herbivores can exert strong indirect effects on other animals by altering the vegetation, the study of trophic cascades retains a focus on apex predators and their top-down forces. Bottom-up trophic interaction chains induced by mammalian herbivores, particularly in invertebrate food webs, remain largely unexplored. We tested whether effects of mammalian herbivores on the vegetation ricochet back up several trophic levels of the invertebrate food web. We further tested two alternative hypotheses: the strength of herbivore-induced indirect interactions either increases with plant productivity because of a concurrent higher grazing intensity, or it decreases because of a higher plant tolerance to grazing. We progressively excluded large, medium and small herbivorous mammals from replicated plots of 6 m2 in productive, intensively grazed short-grass vegetation and less productive, less intensively grazed tall-grass vegetation of subalpine grasslands. We measured vegetation quantity, quality, structure and composition, and determined the abundance of invertebrate herbivores, detritivores, omnivores and predators. We used structural equation modelling to test vegetation-mediated cascading effects of the different mammalian herbivores across different trophic groups of invertebrates. In the short-grass vegetation, mammals caused changes in vegetation quantity and thickness. These changes directly affected detritivorous and predatory invertebrate abundance, yet indirectly affected predatory and omnivorous invertebrates through a bottom-up trophic cascade via changes in herbivorous invertebrate abundance. In the tall-grass vegetation, mammal-induced changes in vegetation quality and composition affected detritivorous invertebrates and in turn omnivorous invertebrates, but these cascading effects were weaker than those in the short-grass vegetation. Smaller mammals were at least as important as large mammals in structuring the invertebrate food web. Our results demonstrate that differently sized mammalian herbivores can trigger trophic cascades in the local invertebrate food web. Our findings further support the hypothesis that herbivore-induced indirect interactions are stronger in more productive systems because of higher foraging intensity, as opposed to the hypothesis that a higher grazing tolerance of plants should dampen herbivore-induced indirect interactions in productive systems.},

   abstract = {Increasing deer and wild boar populations in North America and Western Europe are suspected of threatening low-nesting forest birds. Ungulates may directly affect these birds by predating eggs or chicks, or indirectly attract other mammalian or avian predators or reduce nesting site availability and habitat quality. To test some of these various mechanisms in two French forests, 528 artificial nests, 77 of which (14.6%) were monitored with camera traps, were set up in 44 plots which were either unfenced or fenced to respectively include or exclude ungulates. We used generalized linear mixed models to relate the nest failure rate to indices of plot frequentation by ungulates and other nest predators, to vegetation structure and to local bird community richness indices. Nest failure rate was significantly higher in the unfenced plots (39%) than in the fenced plots (32%) but this was related neither to red deer nor to wild boar frequentation of the plots. Furthermore, levels of frequentation for other mammalian and avian predators tended to be positively correlated to ungulate presence but not to nest failure rate. Nest failure rate depended on both nest height and shrub cover: nests on the ground (31% failure rate) were less predated or disturbed than nests in low shrubs (41% failure rate). Nests surrounded by low shrub cover experienced a slightly higher predation risk. We conclude that ungulates have a limited influence on nest failure for low-nesting forest birds; in particular, they seem to contribute very little to egg predation compared to other predators.},

   abstract = {The past century witnessed a dramatic increase in deer abundance in North America, Western Europe, and Japan, that triggered profound changes in the vegetation structure of temperate forests. Considering the effects large herbivores can have on soil properties and organisms, it is likely that such increased deer abundance will have consequences belowground. Current studies in temperate forests, however, found inconsistent results regarding the effect of deer on soils within, and across, ecosystems. These inconsistencies may be the result of a time-dependent response of the soil to deer presence. Short-term belowground modifications may reflect the direct interactions of deer on soil (i.e. trampling and waste deposition), while long-term belowground modifications may reflect both direct and indirect effects of deer on soil (e.g. through vegetation shifts). To test these ideas, we measured the effects of deer on soil properties and prokaryotic communities in the temperate forests of Haida Gwaii, Canada. We compared three complementary systems varying in duration of deer presence or exclusion, so as to be able to assess the short- (before and after a deer cull), intermediate- (inside vs. outside deer exclosures) and long- (comparing islands with and without deer) term effects of deer, respectively. We found no change in soil physical and chemical properties and in prokaryotic community structure after one year of deer removal. Twenty years of deer exclusion significantly reduced soil compaction but had no effect on soil prokaryotic community structure. Over 70 years of deer presence significantly correlated with: increased soil compaction, reduced total soil phosphorus content and soil prokaryotic diversity, and modified soil prokaryotic community structure and composition. Such effects of deer on the soil may have consequences for nutrient cycling. Revealing the belowground effects of deer in temperate forests, therefore, requires long-term studies, longer than most of those currently available in the literature.},

   abstract = {Windthrow gaps are often regarded as attractive feeding places for roe deer Capreolus capreolus L. because they are considered to provide more forage than undisturbed forest stands. However, for temperate lowland forests in Central Europe, differences in the quantity of forage in gaps and undisturbed forest stands have not yet been quantified. In two deciduous forests in northern Switzerland, we studied seasonal forage availability in undisturbed forest stands compared to windthrow gaps, with the timber either cleared or uncleared, created by the storm Lothar in 1999. To assess the attractiveness of windthrow gaps for foraging roe deer, we measured seasonal browse consumption by roe deer in these three forest structure types. The amount of available forage mainly varied between seasons and, to a lesser extent, between forest structure types. Windthrow gaps did not generally provide larger quantities of food resources than adjacent undisturbed forest stands. Browse consumption was not directly related to forest structure type, but seems to be dependent on the vertical structure of the understory vegetation (herb/shrub layer). Within forest structure types, browse consumption was constant over seasons, but browsing on individual plant species varied according to season and study site. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Among the factors determining the choice of feeding sites by herbivores, the rate of intake of net energy and nutrients is a major one. For grazers, patches of tall grasses are ingested faster, but are digested less fully because of their high fibre contents; conversely, short grass is highly digestible but allows only low intake rates. Herbivores therefore face a trade-off between the quantity and the quality of their food. Little empirical information is available to test whether optimisation models of patch selection are applicable to horses. An experiment was therefore designed where the trade-off between sward height and quality was explored to test explanatory models based on rates of nutrient acquisition (digestible dry matter, energy and/or protein intake rates). Three groups of two 2-year-old saddle horses were grazed on pasture managed to produce three swards differing in both height and quality (vegetative to reproductive stages). They were offered binary choices in a Latin-square design to assess preferences; daily intake was measured to determine the consequences of their choices. Instantaneous intake rates (IIRs) were determined from bite rates at pasture, and bite mass estimated using trays indoors. The taller sward matured during the experiment, so the quality differences between swards increased. The horses selected the taller sward in the first period, and the shorter alternatives in the following ones. The rates of digestible dry matter (DM) and net energy intake were always higher on the tall swards; digestible protein was the best predictor of the horses' choices. Patch selection thus depended on the nutritional context: when digestible protein was not limiting, the horses selected patches where food was ingested faster, and when protein supplies declined, they maximised their protein intake rate. Preferences were however partial: as the shorter swards allowed higher rates of digestible protein intake but lower net energy than the taller swards, the horses may have been balancing their protein and energy intake by feeding on both swards; alternative explanations are discussed. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Principles and criteria for the objective assessment of 'damage' are presented as a basis for objective discussion and to promote targeted research. The topic will be considered from three different viewpoints - theoretical background, silviculture, and nature conservation. Examples of methods to assess 'damage' are given, as are the criteria and indicators for target values for growing stock. The objective existence of damage must be established by comparing the current status against a target. Only if the present status no longer permits achievement of the desired target can damage be claimed. The same is true for verification of 'benefit' resulting from an impact leading to a favorable status. Establishing the degree of browsing damage on forest regeneration allows forecasts of damage to be made, but the actual damage can only be determined at a future time, for example when the timber is harvested or when the function of the forest is seen to have been compromised. The earlier the forecast is made the more uncertain it is, because the compensatory responses of the forest can only be forecast to a limited extent. Silvicultural targets depend on the requirements of both, the forest owner and the public. Main indicators for assessing ungulate damage on forest regeneration are total tree density, species composition, and height structure. From the viewpoint of nature conservation the determination of target values is particularly difficult. The measurement of damage involves choosing the most relevant indicators of favorable condition of woodland habitats and assessing these in the field. With adequate resources this can be done quantitatively using a wide range of standard field measurement techniques. Alternatively, where resources are limited, it can be done qualitatively by scoring different areas for a range of indicators. As yet, such qualitative methods are in their infancy.

Thus, it cannot be recommended as a standard measurement to predict forest development, unless the number of saplings and the height of those saplings are considered. • Context: Browsing by large herbivores may affect regeneration success and forest development, with an impact that lasts for decades. • Aims: Whether the browsing level of a tree species can be used in forestry as a standard measure to assess whether the target values (for instance regeneration success) of highly selected tree species, such as oak (Quercus petraea (Mattuschka) Liebl., Quercus robur (L.)) and fir (Abies alba (Mill.)), will be reached is unclear and need specification. • Methods: In this study, 985 sampling plots (10 m2) in Southern Germany (Baden-Württemberg) containing browsed and unbrowsed oak and fir-saplings were analysed. Both the browsing level and a measure of the expected regeneration success that considered not only the sapling density but also different height classes (≤ 20 cm; 21–50 cm; 51–130 cm) were calculated. • Results: The use of the browsing level as a proxy for the expected regeneration success was statistically only partly justified. For fir the relationship between browsing level and expected regeneration success became even weaker for a new indicator variable which considers two height classes rather than one class for saplings exceeding 50 cm (51–80 cm and 81–130 cm). • Conclusion: According to these results, the browsing level cannot be recommended as a standard measurement and/or predictor of damage, unless the number of saplings and the height of those saplings are considered. Thus, in efforts to mitigate conflicts between foresters and hunters, a measurement is needed that addresses the successful establishment of a sufficient number of trees despite browsing, rather than the browsing of trees alone.},

   abstract = {Ungulates can profoundly alter the structure and composition of forest communities via both direct and indirect mechanisms. Individual plant species often respond in a unique way to the direct effect of herbivory as a function of their sensitivity to browse damage, ungul ate food preferences, and the density of ungulates present. Sustained browsing pressure can limit the regeneration of favored and susceptible woody plants and eliminate populations of favored or susceptible herbaceous plants. These losses, in turn, give rise to indirect effects via trophic cascades or physical habitat modification. These indirect effects affect many other plant and animal populations. In the mixed conifer-hardwood forests around the Great Lakes in North America, widespread habitat modification and the extirpation of native predators and other ungulates have acted to boost populations of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) to historically high densities. Such densities have curtailed regeneration of several important conifers (e.g. Tsuga canadensis and Thuja occidentalis) as evidenced by demographic analysis. Deer also appear to limit regeneration of Quercus and Betula in many areas. Impacts on understory herbs are harder to assess, but baseline data from 50 years ago indicate that these communities are changing in a pattern that implicates deer: grasses, sedges, and some ferns are increasing while overall herb diversity is declining. Thus, deer are playing a keystone role in these communities. We are currently assessing an additional set of questions, including: How best can we measure and represent ungulate impacts? At which densities do deer threaten forest diversity? How do impacts depend on initial plant and ungulate densities? Which species emerge as 'winners' or 'losers' in heavily-browsed landscapes? What characteristics or traits make a species susceptible to ungulate herbivory? How do ungulates affect patterns of diversity and relative abundance in ecological communities? What are the pathways by which ungulates exert indirect effects on species? and How significant are indirect effects? © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Density estimation using camera-trap data is a commonly desired outcome, but most approaches only work for species that can be individually recognized, and researchers studying most mammals are typically constrained to measures of site occupancy or detection rate. These 2 metrics are often used as measures of relative abundance and presumed to be related directly to animal density. To test this relationship, we estimated density, occupancy, and detection rate of male white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) using camera-trap data collected from 1,199 cameras across 20 study sites. Detection rate and density exhibited stronger positive linear correlation (r2 = 0.80) than occupancy and density (r2 = 0.27). When hunted and unhunted paired areas were compared, detection rate and density showed the same trend between paired sites 62.5% of the time compared to 87.5% for occupancy and density. In particular, agreement between estimates was lowest for pairs of sites that had the largest differences in surrounding housing density. Although it is clear occupancy and detection rate contain some information about density, models suggested different ecological relationships associated with the metrics. Using occupancy or detection rate as proxies for density may be particularly problematic when comparing between areas where animals might to move or behave differently, such as urban-wild interfaces. In such cases, alternate methods of density approximation are recommended.},

Detection probabilities for spotlight observers varied between and within observers, ranging from 0.30 (SE = 0.053) to 0.66 (SE = 0.058). Managers commonly assume that although road counts based on convenience sampling designs are imperfect, observers can gather population-trend information from repeated counts along the same survey route. Our results indicate detection rate varied between and within observers and surveyed transects. If detection probabilities are substantially affected by many variables, and if transect selection is not based on appropriate sampling designs, it may be impractical to correct road spotlight counts for detection probabilities to garner unbiased estimates of population size.},

   abstract = {Associational effects, that is, the influence of neighboring plants on herbivory suffered by a plant, are an outcome of forage selection. Although forage selection is a hierarchical process, few studies have investigated associational effects at multiple spatial scales. Because the nutritional quality of plants can be spatially structured, it might differently influence associational effects across multiple scales. Our objective was to determine the radius of influence of neighbor density and nutritional quality on balsam fir (Abies balsamea) herbivory by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in winter. We quantified browsing rates on fir and the density and quality of neighboring trees in a series of 10-year-old cutovers on Anticosti Island (Canada). We used cross-correlations to investigate relationships between browsing rates and the density and nutritional quality of neighboring trees at distances up to 1,000 m. Balsam fir and white spruce (Picea glauca) fiber content and dry matter in vitro true digestibility were correlated with fir browsing rate at the finest extra-patch scale (across distance of up to 50 m) and between cutover areas (300–400 m). These correlations suggest associational effects, that is, low nutritional quality of neighbors reduces the likelihood of fir herbivory (associational defense). Our results may indicate associational effects mediated by intraspecific variation in plant quality and suggest that these effects could occur at scales from tens to hundreds of meters. Understanding associational effects could inform strategies for restoration or conservation; for example, planting of fir among existing natural regeneration could be concentrated in areas of low nutritional quality.},

A multiple regression with five independent variables explained 19% (Scots pine) 14% (birch) and 33% (aspen) of the variation in recent damage. Cover of Scots pine browse was the most important variable for predicting damage to Scots pine and accounted for 44% of the explained variation. When birch was overtopping pine there was a significant increase in damage to pine. Moose index was the only significant variable to explain recent damage to birch, and accounted for 64% of the explained variation. For aspen, damage was negatively correlated to coverage of Scots pine and birch browse, each variable accounting for 38% of the explained variation. For Scots pine, increasing the number of pines ha-1 and performing pre-commercial thinning in such a way that pines are not overtopped may be efficient ways of reducing damage proportions, whereas birch needs to be protected from moose (by a reduction of the moose population or otherwise) in order to escape damage. Increased amounts of Scots pine browse and birch browse may also reduce damage levels to aspen, according to this study.},

In production forestry an understanding of the relationship between ungulate density, habitat-related factors and the incidence of tree damage may promote more efficient ungulate damage management than by lethal control alone. In plantation forests in the north east of England, the incidence of conifer leader browsing by roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) was positively associated with an index of deer density (at the site scale) and planted crop tree density (at the feeding patch scale) and was negatively associated with the relative abundance of palatable understorey vegetation (at the site scale). An interaction between the deer density index and palatable understorey browse abundance was positively associated with leader browsing. Coefficients from the optimal model were used to construct a browse probability surface across a matrix of values of deer dung density and palatable understorey vegetation abundance. This illustrated a very different relationship between dung density and conifer leader browsing probability across the various levels of palatable understorey vegetation abundance. From this we hypothesise that in areas of limited palatable understorey vegetation abundance, higher levels of culling may be required to achieve reductions in the incidence of conifer leader browsing than would be necessary in areas with moderate to high palatable understorey vegetation abundance. Improvements to understorey vegetation in concert with roe deer population control may enhance the efficiency of deer damage management in upland areas with nutrient-poor soils.

The prevailing hypothesis explaining this pattern states that, as resource availability increases, well-defended, slow-growing species are replaced by poorly defended, fast-growing species. A second hypothesis states that greater resource availability increases allocation to growth at the expense of defense, within species. Regardless of mechanism, if exotic species are released from enemies relative to natives, shifts in allocation to growth and defense both within and among species could differ by geographic provenance. To test whether resource availability alters growth or defense, within and among species, and whether any such effects differ between natives and exotics, we manipulated soil nutrient supply and access of aboveground insect herbivores and fungal pathogens under field conditions to individuals of six native and six exotic grass species that co-occurred in a North Carolina old field. The prevailing hypothesis’ prediction—that species-level enemy impact increases with species’ nutrient responsiveness—was confirmed. Moreover, this relationship did not differ between native and exotic species. The second hypothesis’ prediction—that individual-level enemy impact increases with nutrient supply, after accounting for species-level variation in performance—was not supported. Together, these results support the idea, across native and exotic species, that plant species turnover is the primary mechanism underlying effects of nutrient enrichment on allocation to growth and defense in plant communities.},

   abstract = {Forests in eastern North America are experiencing high densities of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and encroachment by invasive plants, both of which threaten native biodiversity. We review the literature on deer and invasive plant impacts focusing on studies that simultaneously evaluate the consequences of both. Deer have more frequent and more consistently negative effects than invasive plants. Widespread deer impacts now threaten many native plant species through much of their range. In contrast, invasive plant effects currently remain more localized and/or of smaller extent within forests. Deer impacts are also cumulative, hitting preferred plant species especially hard as they decline in density. This generates difficult-to-reverse legacy effects. Invasive plant effects, in contrast, tend to be more diffuse and may be more readily reversed. High deer populations also shift physical and chemical conditions in soils promoting “invasion cascades” involving non-native earthworms and certain introduced plants. Removing invasive plants without reducing deer populations can increase deer impacts on native species. Management should be integrated to address both deer and invasive plants. To safeguard and restore native biota when resources are limited, however, it may be most effective for managers to first reduce deer populations before investing in efforts to reduce invasive populations (except when invasions are at an early stage). We should rethink and reform traditional approaches to managing deer so that we can better integrate land vegetation with wildlife management to achieve broad public objectives. Interacting effects of high ungulate populations and invasive plants deserve further study to determine whether similar recommendations apply to other regions.},

Recent advances have partially validated previous theoretical predictions and improved our understanding of tolerance. Here, I highlight the necessity of integrating tolerance into ecological and co-evolutionary theory to better understand the biology of this defensive mechanism. 2.Existing work has been biased toward understanding the adaptive nature and constraints acting on tolerance rather than its ecological implications. Increasing consensus that tolerance may alter the classical antagonistic dynamic between plants and herbivores suggests possible avenues to explore its population and community consequences. 3.In this review, I summarize previous advances in the ecology and evolution of tolerance to herbivory. I also discuss recent evidence that improves our understanding of unresolved issues such as the specificity of tolerance in response to herbivory, its role as an agent of selection on herbivores, and its ecological and evolutionary consequences which include a role of tolerance during biological invasions. 4.Although there is good support for an adaptive role of tolerance in response to herbivory damage, tolerance can itself impose selection on herbivores. Furthermore, tolerance can influence herbivore population dynamics and coexistence, as recent studies show that tolerance responses increase diversity of the associated herbivore communities on individual host plants. 5.Future studies that take into account the role of herbivores on the expression of tolerance will provide novel insight that will help disentangle the mechanisms of tolerance and its ecological and evolutionary implications. © 2010 The Author.

Understanding plant trait responses to environmental changes such as grazing patterns, nutrient enrichment and climate warming is, thus, essential for predicting the composition of future plant communities. We measured traits of eight common tundra species in a fully factorial field experiment with mammalian herbivore exclusion, fertilization, and passive warming, and assessed how trait responsiveness to the treatments was associated with abundance changes in those treatments. Herbivory exhibited the strongest impact on traits. Exclusion of herbivores increased vegetative plant height by 50% and specific leaf area (SLA) by 19%, and decreased foliar C:N by 11%; fertilization and warming also increased height and SLA but to a smaller extent. Herbivory also modulated intraspecific height, SLA and foliar C:N responses to fertilization and warming, and these interactions were species-specific. Furthermore, herbivory affected how trait change translated into relative abundance change: increased height under warming and fertilization was more positively related to abundance change inside fences than in grazed plots. Our findings highlight the key role of mammalian herbivory when assessing intraspecific trait change in tundra and its consequences for plant performance under global changes.},

   abstract = {Herbivory and competition are two of the most common biotic stressors for plants. When occurring simultaneously, responses to one interaction can constrain the induction of responses to the other interaction due to resource limitation and other interactive effects. Thus, to maximize fitness when interacting with competitors and herbivores, plants are likely to express particular combinations of plastic responses. This study reports the interactive effects of herbivory and competition on responses induced in Tithonia tubaeformis plants and describes how natural selection acts on particular plastic responses and on their different combinations. Competition induced a stem elongation response, expressed through an increase in height and mean internode length, together with a decrease in basal diameter. Interestingly, realized, resistance increased in both competition and herbivory treatments, suggesting a plastic response in both constitutive and induced resistance traits. Particular combinations of plastic responses defined three plant phenotypes: vigorous, elongated, and resistant plants. The ecological context in which plants grew modified the traits and the particular combinations of plastic responses that were favored by selection. Vigorous plants were favored by selection in all environments, except when they were damaged by herbivores in the absence of neighbors. The combination of responses defining an elongated plant phenotype was favored by selection in crowded conditions. Resistance was negatively selected in the absence of competition and herbivory but favored in the presence of both interactions. In addition, contextual analyses detected that population structure in heterogeneous environments can also influence the outcomes of selection. These findings suggest that natural selection can act on particular combinations of plastic responses, which may allow plants to adjust their phenotypes to those that promote greater fitness under particular ecological conditions. © 2010 by the Ecological society of America.},

   abstract = {We compared the potential for compensatory growth of two grass species from the Mongolian steppe that differ in their ability to persist under grazing: the rhizomatous Leymus chinensis and the caespitose Stipa krylovii, and investigated how this ability might be affected by drought. Plants were grown in a greenhouse under wet and dry conditions and subjected to a clipping treatment (biweekly removal of 75-90% of the aerial mass). Leymus exhibited a much stronger compensatory growth after clipping than Stipa. Leymus showed a significant increase in its relative growth rate (RGR) after clipping, while for Stipa RGR was negatively affected. Clipped Leymus plants maintained leaf productivity levels that were similar to undamaged individuals, while leaf-productivity in clipped Stipa dropped to less than half of that of the controls. In Leymus, there was less compensatory growth under dry than under wet conditions, while in Stipa the compensation was increased under drought. This difference probably reflects the fact that Stipa is more drought-tolerant than Leymus. The greater compensatory growth of Leymus compared to Stipa mainly resulted from a greater stimulation of its net assimilation rate (NAR), and its greater capacity to store and reallocate carbohydrates by clipping. The greater increase in NAR was probably the result of a stronger reduction in self-shading, because Leymus shoots were much denser than those of Stipa, which resulted in a higher increase in light penetration to remaining leaves after clipping. The results of this study suggest that the greater ability of Leymus to persist under grazing is the result of its larger capacity for compensatory growth. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

   abstract = {Plant plastic responses to herbivore damage may include rapid, active reallocation of plant resources to reduce the impact of herbivory on future plant fitness. However, whether these inducible tolerance responses can be extended to pine trees and how these responses could be modulated by genetic and environmental factors remains unclear. Biomass allocation and phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) concentrations in above- and below-ground tissues were measured in Pinus pinaster juveniles belonging to 33 open-pollinated families grown under two P availabilities (P-deficient and complete fertilization). Measurements were taken 15days after half of the plants received a foliar spray treatment of 22mmolL -1 methyl jasmonate (MJ) to simulate above-ground herbivore attack. Simulated above-ground herbivory promoted a strong preferential allocation of biomass below ground in the form of fine roots, leading to an almost two-fold increase in fine root biomass in MJ-treated plants and a significant reduction in above-ground tissues and coarse roots. In addition, MJ signalling increased P and N concentrations in the shoots while reducing (P) or maintaining (N) concentrations in the roots. These results suggest that induced resource sequestration is not a generalized strategy in this pine species. Fine root biomass and concentration of N and P in plant tissues showed additive genetic variation, but responses to MJ signalling did not vary among families. Allocation of biomass to fine roots was not affected by P availability, whereas allocation of P to the shoot was more intense under complete fertilization. Synthesis: Two new putative tolerance mechanisms inducible by MJ signalling may help to minimize the impact of above-ground herbivore damage on the future fitness of young pine trees by (i) allocation of carbon to fine roots, this appeared to be a generalized strategy with weak environmental modulation and (ii) reallocation of P and N from roots to shoots, which was largely affected by P availability, and thus susceptible to greater phenotypic variation in heterogeneous environments. We provide evidence that changes in tolerance-related traits are rapidly inducible by herbivory cues in this pine species. These results should be integrated with induced resistance responses to fully understand the costs and benefits associated with induced responses to herbivory. © 2011 The Authors.

Quantitative models are frequently employed to tackle the complexities associated with disturbance processes. Here we review the wide variety of approaches to modelling natural disturbances in forest ecosystems, addressing the full spectrum of disturbance modelling from single events to integrated disturbance regimes. We applied a general, process-based framework founded in disturbance ecology to analyze modelling approaches for drought, wind, forest fires, insect pests and ungulate browsing. Modelling approaches were reviewed by disturbance agent and mechanism, and a set of general disturbance modelling concepts was deduced. We found that although the number of disturbance modelling approaches emerging over the last 15 years has increased strongly, statistical concepts for descriptive modelling are still largely prevalent over mechanistic concepts for explanatory and predictive applications. Yet, considering the increasing importance of disturbances for forest dynamics and ecosystem stewardship under anthropogenic climate change, the latter concepts are crucial tool for understanding and coping with change in forest ecosystems. Current challenges for disturbance modelling in forest ecosystems are thus (i) to overcome remaining limits in process understanding, (ii) to further a mechanistic foundation in disturbance modelling, (iii) to integrate multiple disturbance processes in dynamic ecosystem models for decision support in forest management, and (iv) to bring together scaling capabilities across several levels of organization with a representation of system complexity that captures the emergent behaviour of disturbance regimes. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {I introduced forest dynamics to a deterministic herbivore-vegetation model to examine the effects of vertically stratified forest structure on the dynamics of the herbivore-vegetation system, the resilience and stable states of vegetation, and the interactions between deer populations and vegetation. I constructed a model based on data from field studies performed in Hokkaido, northern Japan. Three phases of state were identified for a given deer density: (1) understory vegetation is maintained with a equilibrium proportion of canopy gaps in the absence of deer; (2) if the equilibrium proportion of canopy gaps is greater than that in the equilibrium state in the absence of deer, the understory vegetation can be maintained; and (3) the understory vegetation cannot be maintained. At the boundary between phases 2 and 3, the herbivore population level had discontinuous effects on vegetation. When the deer density was held below the threshold, forest vegetation had resilience to recover to the equilibrium stable state at the given deer density, although the equilibrium canopy gap ratio and vegetation biomass differed with deer density. However, the forest vegetation-herbivore system could not be maintained in a stable state without artificial deer population management if food limitation was the only mechanism to keep the deer population at low levels. The deer population must be kept below the boundary between phases 1 and 2 to maintain the forest regeneration processes. The level cannot be determined by observing the deer population; careful observation of forest regeneration processes is required. © 2008 The Ecological Society of Japan.},

Rotation periods ranged from 69 yr for  > 10% canopy removal to 3734 yr for  > 70% canopy removal. Stands were classified into eight structural types, ranging from even-aged sapling stands to steady-state stands, which reflect the state of recovery from recent disturbances. The model suggests that most (87.4%) stands in the primeval hardwood forest were multi-aged, with several major and many minor age classes. Quasi-even-aged stands resulting from catastrophic disturbance occupied 9.2% of the landscape, and steady-state stands about 3.6%. The low frequency of steady-state stands on the landscape appears to be determined primarily by the high frequency of disturbances removing part of the canopy, rather than the interval between catastrophes. Changes in disturbance rates result in disproportionately large changes in the proportion of even-aged stands on the landscape, while mean canopy residence time for trees shows a damped effect. -Authors},

While acknowledging the importance of co-drivers, the classical view is still that carbon, that is, photosynthetic CO2uptake, ranks above any other drivers of plant growth. Hence, theory and modelling of growth traditionally is carbon centric. Here, I suggest that this view is not reflecting reality, but emerged from the availability of methods and process understanding at leaf level. In most cases, poorly understood processes of tissue formation and cell growth are governing carbon demand, and thus, CO2uptake. Carbon can only be converted into biomass to the extent chemical elements other than carbon, temperature or cell turgor permit.},

   abstract = {Insect herbivore performance and arthropod communities can be affected by mammalian grazing and browsing via altered plant communities and vegetation structure. Far less is known about whether changes to plant architecture can cause similar effects. Browsing generated changes to within plant architecture could potentially have large consequences for arthropod communities, herbivore survival and eventually damage to plants. This study investigates plant-mediated effects of ungulate browsing on arthropod predator communities and on the survival of herbivorous insects. More specifically we studied how different levels of ungulate browsing (1) influenced the arthropod predator community on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and (2) affected the survival of the European pine sawfly (Neodiprion sertifer). We related these response variables to browsing-inflicted changes in pine architecture. An observational study of generalist arthropod predators on pine trees revealed a trend toward a quadratic response of ants to browsing intensity—i.e., a higher abundance of ants on moderately browsed trees and lower abundance on intensively browsed trees. A field survey of sawfly larvae revealed a 19% lower larval survival on browsed compared to un-browsed pines, but no difference in survival comparing pines with moderate and high intensity of browsing. A structural equation model revealed that moose generated changes to pine architecture had only a small effect on sawfly larval survival, suggesting additional mediating pine traits affected by browsing. We conclude that insect survival can be altered by ungulate browsing, which could affect damage levels.},

   abstract = {Northern mid-latitude forests are a large terrestrial carbon sink. Ignoring nutrient limitations, large increases in carbon sequestration from carbon dioxide (CO2) fertilization are expected in these forests. Yet, forests are usually relegated to sites of moderate to poor fertility, where tree growth is often limited by nutrient supply, in particular nitrogen. Here we present evidence that estimates of increases in carbon sequestration of forests, which is expected to partially compensate for increasing CO2 in the atmosphere, are unduly optimistic. In two forest experiments on maturing pines exposed to elevated atmospheric CO2, the CO2-induced biomass carbon increment without added nutrients was undetectable at a nutritionally poor site, and the stimulation at a nutritionally moderate site was transient, stabilizing at a marginal gain after three years. However, a large synergistic gain from higher CO2 and nutrients was detected with nutrients added. This gain was even larger at the poor site (threefold higher than the expected additive effect) than at the moderate site (twofold higher). Thus, fertility can restrain the response of wood carbon sequestration to increased atmospheric CO2. Assessment of future carbon sequestration should consider the limitations imposed by soil fertility, as well as interactions with nitrogen deposition.},

However, global maps of nutrient limitation are still lacking. Here we examined global N and P limitation using the ratio of site-averaged leaf N and P resorption efficiencies of the dominant species across 171 sites. We evaluated our predictions using a global database of N- and P-limitation experiments based on nutrient additions at 106 and 53 sites, respectively. Globally, we found a shift from relative P to N limitation for both higher latitudes and precipitation seasonality and lower mean annual temperature, temperature seasonality, mean annual precipitation and soil clay fraction. Excluding cropland, urban and glacial areas, we estimate that 18% of the natural terrestrial land area is significantly limited by N, whereas 43% is relatively P limited. The remaining 39% of the natural terrestrial land area could be co-limited by N and P or weakly limited by either nutrient alone. This work provides both a new framework for testing nutrient limitation and a benchmark of N and P limitation for models to constrain predictions of the terrestrial carbon sink.},

However, at an ecosystem scale, increased photosynthetic rates are not always translated into faster tree growth, and in free air carbon enrichment (FACE) experiments with trees, the stimulation in above-ground growth often declines with time. So is tree growth C-limited? The evidence is reviewed here at three different scales. First, at the biochemical scale, the role of Rubisco is discussed by considering its evolution and role as a nitrogen (N) storage protein. Second, at the ecophysiological scale, C allocation to gain nutrients from the soil is considered and it is argued that any C limitation is only through a limitation to soil nutrient cycling. Finally, the response of forest ecosystems to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations is considered and evidence from FACE experiments is discussed. From the three lines of evidence we conclude that the growth of trees is not C-limited, with the key to understanding future responses to climate change being turnover of soil organic matter and nutrient cycling. © The Authors (2007).},

   abstract = {Background and aims - A large variety of methods are used by ecologists for studies at plant community level. While early works were mainly descriptive, more manipulative experiments are now being undertaken because they provide a better functional understanding and a greater insight into underlying mechanisms. Mathematical models are also being increasingly used, in particular for predicting biodiversity under global change. The aim of this study is to highlight the strengths, limitations, and advantages of these three approaches, namely observational, experimental and theoretical modelling. Methods - We assessed 149 papers published during the last four years in three specialized disciplinary journals (DJ) and 151 papers in three generalist high impact journals (HIJ) dealing with plant ecology, and checked the methods that were used. We asked participants of the ECOVEG7 meeting held in Switzerland (Lausanne, April 2011) whether observational, experimental and theoretical modelling approaches can, or should, be used alone or in combination when studying plant communities and ecosystem functioning in the context of global change. Key results - About 50% of articles published in both journal types used only a single approach. Nevertheless, papers in HIJ used the approaches in similar proportions, while articles in DJ had eight times more observational than modelling studies. Combined approaches represented only 8% in DJ, while this percentage was more than double in HIJ. Conclusion - Plant community ecologists favour a combination of several approaches, but for practical difficulties (communicating among people using different approaches and publication strategies), singleapproach studies are generally preferred. A combination of the three highlighted approaches seems to be the most appropriate way to respond to future challenges in plant community ecology such as biodiversity loss and impact of climate change as such studies require work on different temporal and spatial scales. © 2012 National Botanic Garden of Belgium and Royal Botanical Society of Belgium.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

   abstract = {Background and Aims The coexistence of forest tree species has often been linked to differences among species in terms of their response to light availability during the regeneration stage. From this perspective, species coexistence results from growth-growth or mortality-growth trade-offs along spatial light gradients. Experimental evidence of growth-growth trade-offs in natural conditions is sparse due to various confounding factors that potentially hinder the relationship. This study examined growth hierarchies along light gradients between two tree species with contrasting shade tolerance by controlling potential confounding factors such as seedling size, seedling status, seedling density and species composition. Methods Natural regenerated shade-tolerant Fagus sylvatica and shade-intermediate Quercus petraea seedlings were used, and growth rankings over a 4-year period were compared in 8- to 10-year-old tree seedlings. Key resultsNorank reversal occurs between the two species along the light gradient, or along the density, mixture or seedling size gradients.The shade-tolerant specieswas always themore competitive of the two. Pronounced effects of initial size on seedling growth were observed, whereas the effects of light and competition by neighbours were of secondary importance. The paramount effect of size, which results fromthe asymmetric nature of interseedling competition, gives a strong advantage to tall seedlings over the long term. ConclusionsThis studyextendsprevious effortsto identifypotentialdriversof rankreversals in young treemixtures. It does not support the classical assumption that spatial heterogeneity in canopy opening explains the coexistence of the two species studied. It suggests that spatial variation in local size hierarchies among seedlings that may be caused by seedling emergence time or seedling initial performance is the main driver of the dynamics of these mixed stands. © The Author 2013.},

   abstract = {Recolonization of Europe by forest tree species after the last glaciation is well documented in the fossil pollen record. This spread may have been achieved at low densities by rare events of long-distance dispersal, rather than by a compact wave of advance, generating a patchy genetic structure through founder effects. In long-lived oak species, this structure could still be discernible by using maternally transmitted genetic markers. To test this hypothesis, a fine-scale study of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) variability of two sympatric oak species was carried out in western France. The distributions of six cpDNA length variants were analyzed at 188 localities over a 200 x 300 km area. A cpDNA map was obtained by applying geostatistics methods to the complete data set. Patches of several hundred square kilometers exist which are virtually fixed for a single haplotype for both oak species. This local systematic interspecific sharing of the maternal genome strongly suggests that long-distance seed dispersal events followed by interspecific exchanges were involved at the time of colonization, about 10,000 years ago.},

   abstract = {The geographic distribution throughout Europe of each of 32 chloroplast DNA variants belonging to eight white oak species sampled from 2613 populations is presented. Clear-cut geographic patterns were revealed by the survey. These distributions, together with the available palynological information, were used to infer colonisation routes out of the glacial period refugia. In western Europe in particular, movements out of the Iberian and the Italian Peninsulas can be clearly identified. Separate refugia are also present in eastern Balkans, whereas further west in this peninsula similarities with Italy were evident. Movements resulting in the exchange of haplotypes between refugia both during the present interglacial and probably also during earlier glacial cycles were therefore inferred. The consequences of these past exchanges is that phylogenetically divergent haplotypes have sometimes followed very similar colonisation routes, limiting somewhat the phylogeographic structure. Cases of geographic disjunction in the present-day distribution of haplotypes are also apparent and could have been induced by the existence of rapid climatic changes at the end of the glacial period (specifically the Younger Dryas cold period), which resulted in range restriction following an early warm period during which oak first expanded from its primary refugia. This cold phase was followed by a new period of expansion at the outset of the Holocene, involving in some cases 'secondary' refugia. It is expected that these short climate oscillations would have led to a partial reshuffling of haplotype distribution. Early association between haplotypes and oak species are also suggested by the data, although extensive introgression among species has ultimately largely blurred the pattern. This implies that colonisation routes may have been initially constrained by the ecological characteristics of the species hosting each chloroplast variant. We suggest for instance that two oak species distributed in the north of the Iberian Peninsula (Quercus petraea and Q. pubescens) are recent post-glacial immigrants there. When considered together, conclusions on the location of glacial period refugia and the colonisation routes derived from molecular information and fossil pollen data appear to be both largely compatible and complementary. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Synthesizing conclusions reached during the past three decades by complementary approaches in phylogenetics, phylogeography, genomics, ecology, paleobotany, population biology and quantitative genetics, this review aims to illuminate evolutionary processes leading to the radiation and expansion of oaks. From opposing scales of time and geography, we converge on four overarching explanations of evolutionary success in oaks: accumulation of large reservoirs of diversity within populations and species; ability for rapid migration contributing to ecological priority effects on lineage diversification; high rates of evolutionary divergence within clades combined with convergent solutions to ecological problems across clades; and propensity for hybridization, contributing to adaptive introgression and facilitating migration. Finally, we explore potential future research avenues, emphasizing the integration of microevolutionary and macroevolutionary perspectives.},

   abstract = {Compared with conventional planting, direct seeding of Quercus spp. is a method that can reduce the costs of reforestation considerably. However, interference from natural vegetation and predation on acorns contribute to regeneration failures. Mechanical site preparation has the potential to reduce both these problems. To study the influence of sowing date and of different mechanical site preparation treatments on early seedling growth, an experiment was carried out in storm-felled areas, formerly Norway spruce forests, in southern Sweden from May 2006 to September 2008. Five treatments were applied and acorns were planted in May and July 2006. The treatments were: disc trenching, patch scarification, topsoil removal, mounding and an undisturbed control. A delay of less than two months in seeding resulted in the equivalent of one year's growth reduction with respect to oak seedling's height and biomass. This could be explained by delayed emergence of seedlings, and by the dry conditions during summer seeding. The seedlings only exhibited a weak positive biomass growth response following disc trenching, patch scarification and top soil removal. In the latter case this might be explained by increased soil compaction and extensive removal of the humus layer. Site preparation by mounding resulted in good vegetation control, an increased biomass growth response and deeper seedling roots. In this treatment, we found high relative light levels near seedlings, reduced soil moisture and dry bulk density of the soil and higher soil temperatures.

   abstract = {Predicting the evolutionary potential of natural tree populations requires the estimation of heritability and genetic correlations among traits on which selection acts, as differences in evolutionary success between species may rely on differences for these genetic parameters. In situ estimates are expected to be more accurate than measures done under controlled conditions which do not reflect the natural environmental variance. The aim of the current study was to estimate three genetic parameters (i.e., heritability, evolvability, and genetic correlations) in a natural mixed oak stand composed of Quercus petraea and Quercus robur about 100 years old, for 58 traits of ecological, and functional relevance (growth, reproduction, phenology, physiology, resilience, structure, morphology, and defense). First, we estimated genetic parameters directly in situ using realized genomic relatedness of adult trees and parentage relationships over two generations to estimate the traits’ additive variance. Secondly, we benefited from existing ex situ experiments (progeny tests and conservation collection) installed with the same populations, thus allowing comparisons of in situ heritability estimates with more traditional methods. Heritability and evolvability estimates obtained with different methods varied substantially and showed large confidence intervals; however, we found that in situ were less precise than ex situ estimates, and assessments over two generations (with deeper relatedness) improved estimates of heritability while large sampling sizes are needed for accurate estimations. At the biological level, heritability values varied moderately across different ecological and functional categories of traits, and genetic correlations among traits were conserved over the two species. We identified limits for using realized genomic relatedness in natural stands to estimate the genetic variance, given the overall low variance of genetic relatedness and the rather low sampling sizes of currently used long-term genetic plots in forestry. These limits can be overcome if larger sample sizes are considered, or if the approach is extended over the next generation.},

   abstract = {Planting bare-rooted seedlings is a rather expensive method to regenerate oak (Quercus robur) and beech (Fagus sylvatica). Direct seeding could reduce artificial regeneration costs substantially, but the method currently suffers from a number of problems, one of which is seed consumption by rodents. In the present study clear-cut areas in southern Sweden were prepared using one of four different mechanical site preparation methods - disc trenching, patch scarification, topsoil removal or mounding - then manually sown with acorns and beech nuts. Acorns were sown in May and July 2006, and both acorns and beech nuts were sown in May 2007. Three years following sowing, best seedling establishment from viable acorns, 60-70%, was achieved after sowing in mounds in May, and the subsequent survival reached 90-100%. After the first growing season for beech, both seedling establishment and subsequent survival was lower than for oak, which coincides with a higher number of lost beech nuts at the excavation to investigate the fate of seeds. Granivorous rodents (Apodemus flavicollis, A. sylvaticus, Mus musculus, and Myodes glareolus) were live-trapped more frequently in the vicinity of slash piles compared to other micro-site features, such as uprooted stumps, snags and stones. In 2006, no connection was found between number of rodents captured and proportion of lost seeds, while in 2007 the two were in good accordance. No clear relationship was found between number of captured rodents, vegetation cover class and mechanical site preparation method. More rodents were captured in 2007 than in 2006, and there was an increase in captures from spring until late summer/autumn for both years, which was mirrored in the seedling establishment result from the three different times of sowing. Based on experiences from the present study the recommendation for successful direct seeding of oak on clear-cuts is a combination of mounding site preparation, removal of slash and sowing in May rather than July. However, the results indicate that successful direct seeding of beech is more difficult to achieve. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Species differences in seedling survival in deeply shaded understories (i.e., shade tolerance) may depend on both seed size and growth rates, but their relative contributions to survival and how they change with time and with variation in light and belowground resource availability is unknown. With a greenhouse experiment we investigated these relationships by examining responses of growth, growth-related morphology, survival, and their interrelationships to a range of nitrogen (3.4 x 10-9-3.4 x 10-3 mol/L N fertilizer solutions) and low light (0.6-7.3% of open sky) availabilities for young seedlings of 10 North American tree species that vary in observational shade tolerance rankings and seed size (Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera, Betula alleghaniensis, Acer saccharum, Larix laricina, Pinus banksiana, Pinus resinosa, Pinus strobus, Picea mariana, and Abies hair samea). Within all species, relative growth rate (RGR) and survival increased with light RGR and survival also increased with N supply but only at the two highest light levels, and then only for the shade-intolerant, broad-leaved Populus and Betula spp.. In every species, survival was positively related to RGR. Moreover, each species differed in the relationship of survival to RGR, and these differences were related to seed mass: at any given RGR, large-seeded, shade-tolerant species had higher survival than smaller-seeded, intolerant ones. Across species, in most light and N treatments, seed mass was positively related to young seedling survival, but RGR was not. In very low light the relative benefits of greater seed mass to survival were temporary. As seedlings aged, interspecific mortality rates became more dependent on observational shade tolerance rankings than on seed size, but mortality was still unrelated to RGR. Our results indicate potentially important interactions among light, N, and species that could influence regeneration dynamics. For young seedlings in deeply shaded microsites, N supply does not matter, and only shade-tolerant species survive due, in part, to large seeds and physiological traits other than RGR. In moderate shade, RGR is greater, and survival is high for all species, except that small-seeded, broad-leaved, intolerant species have low survival and RGR at low N supply. This suggests that broad-leaved shade-intolerant species compete more effectively in moderate shade on richer soils than on poorer soils. Although we found that both seed mass and vegetative physiology influenced survival in shade, they did not covary tightly, suggesting that they are under somewhat separate selection pressures.},

   abstract = {Mounding site preparation for forest restoration: survival and short term growth response in Quercus robur L. seedlings control of natural vegetation during afforestation and reforestation is necessary to avoid economical losses through growth reduction and mortality in seedlings. The present field experiment, carried out on a ground-water influenced site with planted oak, included three site preparation treatments and undisturbed control (C). The treatments were: repeated herbicide application (H), mounding site preparation (MSP), and mounding site preparation in combination with repeated herbicide application (MSP + H). The mounds were 25 m long, 2 m wide and 20 cm high inverted mounds on humus, and this method is sometimes also called bedding. Seedlings were monitored for 3 years and at the end of the experiment 90% of oak seedlings survived in the various site preparation methods compared with 58% in the undisturbed control. The best growth was obtained when mounding site preparation was combined with repeated herbicide treatment, producing five times greater seedling biomass compared with the control. Mounding site preparation resulted in equal growth of seedlings compared with repeated herbicide application. Interference from vegetation had a strong negative effect on seedling growth while mounding site preparation itself resulted in a positive seedling growth response. We conclude that mounding site preparation is an efficient tool for forest managers in establishing oak stands and is a good alternative to herbicide treatment on certain sites. On the other hand, a relatively large disturbance area and deep soil disturbances may impair recreational values and destroy archaeological remains. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

To define a critical groundwater table which would permit successful regeneration, planted and naturally grown seedlings were compared in two forests differing in the degree of decline and physiological weakness of adult pedunculate oak trees. Comparison of stomatal conductance and pre-dawn water potential (PWP) showed differences of seedlings between and within forest complexes. Stomatal conductance dropped below 100 mmol m-2s-1 at PWP values below -1.0 MPa, while closure of stomata was caused by a PWP between -1.6 and -1.9 MPa.

   abstract = {Human alterations to nutrient cycles and herbivore communities are affecting global biodiversity dramatically. Ecological theory predicts these changes should be strongly counteractive: nutrient addition drives plant species loss through intensified competition for light, whereas herbivores prevent competitive exclusion by increasing ground-level light, particularly in productive systems. Here we use experimental data spanning a globally relevant range of conditions to test the hypothesis that herbaceous plant species losses caused by eutrophication may be offset by increased light availability due to herbivory. This experiment, replicated in 40 grasslands on 6 continents, demonstrates that nutrients and herbivores can serve as counteracting forces to control local plant diversity through light limitation, independent of site productivity, soil nitrogen, herbivore type and climate. Nutrient addition consistently reduced local diversity through light limitation, and herbivory rescued diversity at sites where it alleviated light limitation. Thus, species loss from anthropogenic eutrophication can be ameliorated in grasslands where herbivory increases ground-level light. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

Conducted in south-western Germany, this study examined photosynthetic performance and height growth of naturally regenerated 7-year-old sessile oak (Quercus petraea [Mattuschka] Liebl.) seedlings growing in artificially established and fenced canopy openings varying from 0.05 to 0.2 ha in size. We quantified the influence of solar radiation and competing vegetation within gaps on total height, height increment, and dominance of oak seedlings. Measurements were taken on plots systematically established along a north–south transect through gaps. Plot-level solar radiation levels within canopy openings quantified using the total site factor (TSF) were between 20% at southerly positions within small openings and up to 75% of open-field conditions at the centre of larger gaps. Photosynthetic performance, total height, and shoot length of the studied oak seedlings increased with increasing solar radiation. However, height increment and total height did not improve substantially when radiation levels increased from 20 to 50% TSF. Yet, highest levels of oak dominance, where oaks were the tallest individual at a plot, were found around 50% of TSF. Under the conditions at our research site, canopy openings of at least 0.2 ha in size appear necessary to successfully establish natural oak regeneration. Irrespective of gap size, the competition to oaks by woody species needs to be controlled to reduce the risk of regeneration failure.},

   abstract = {Plant interactions can be defined as the ways plants act upon the growth, fitness, survival and reproduction of other plants, largely by modifying their environment. These interactions can be positive (facilitation) or negative (competition or exploitation). During plantation establishment or natural forest regeneration after a disturbance, high light levels and, sometimes, increased availability of water and nutrients favour the development of opportunistic, fast-growing herbaceous and woody species which capture resources at the expense of crop trees. As a consequence, the growth and survival of crop trees can be dramatically reduced. Although the effects of this competition are well documented, the physical and physiological mechanisms of competition are not. Moreover, the competition process is never constant in time or space. We present a conceptual competition model based on plant growth forms common in global forests, i.e. graminoids, forbs, small shrubs, large shrubs and mid-storey trees, and main-storey trees. Their competitive attributes and successional dynamics are examined. An overview is presented on the way forest vegetation management (FVM) treatments influence these components and outcomes regarding crop tree performance and diversity conservation. Finally, a synthesis of literature yields FVM guidelines for efficiently optimizing crop tree performance and safeguarding diversity. Future research needs to further sustainable FVM are presented. © Institute of Chartered Foresters, 2006. All rights reserved.},

A more general contingency model of optimal diet choice is developed, allowing for simultaneous searching and handling, which extends the theory to include grazing and browsing by large herbivores. 2. Foraging resolves into three modes: purely encounter-limited, purely handling-limited and mixed-process, in which either a handling-limited prey type is added to an encounter-limited diet, or the diet becomes handling-limited as it expands. 3. The purely encounter-limited diet is, in general, broader than that predicted by the conventional contingency model. 4. As the degree of simultaneity of searching and handling increases, the optimal diet expands to the point where it is handling-limited, at which point all inferior prey types are rejected. 5. Inclusion of a less profitable prey species is not necessarily independent of its encounter rate and the zero-one rule does not necessarily hold: some of the less profitable prey may be included in the optimal diet. This gives an optimal foraging explanation for herbivores' mixed diets. 6. Rules are shown for calculating the boundary between encounter-limited and handling-limited diets and for predicting the proportion of inferior prey to be included in a two-species diet. 7. The digestive rate model is modified to include simultaneous searching and handling, showing that the more they overlap, the more the predicted diet-breadth is likely to be reduced.},

Resource dynamics, pollination success, and, as described here, environmental veto are possible proximate mechanisms driving masting. We explored the environmental veto hypothesis, which assumes that reproductive synchrony is driven by external factors preventing reproduction in some years, by extending the resource budget model of masting with correlated reproductive failure. We ran this model across its parameter space to explore how key parameters interact to drive seeding dynamics. Next, we parameterized the model based on 16 yr of seed production data for populations of red (Quercus rubra) and white (Quercus alba) oaks. We used these empirical models to simulate seeding dynamics, and compared simulated time series with patterns observed in the field. Simulations showed that resource dynamics and reproduction failure can produce masting even in the absence of pollen coupling. In concordance with this, in both oaks, among-year variation in resource gain and correlated reproductive failure were necessary and sufficient to reproduce masting, whereas pollen coupling, although present, was not necessary. Reproductive failure caused by environmental veto may drive large-scale synchronization without density-dependent pollen limitation. Reproduction-inhibiting weather events are prevalent in ecosystems, making described mechanisms likely to operate in many systems.},

   abstract = {Impacts of herbivory by wild ungulates represent a significant issue world-wide. To be effective, management of populations and impacts needs to be coordinated above the site scale, yet little research has investigated the appropriate spatial scale over which management should be integrated to be fully effective. In consideration of reduction of impacts in deciduous or mixed woodland habitats, we tested scale-specific management effectiveness in a lowland area of UK where moderate- to high-density populations of four deer species were the target of deliberate control programmes, and nonhuman predators were absent. We modelled the annual impact recorded between 2009 and 2015 in 98 woodlands as a function of cumulative culls of deer taken since the commencement of management. Analysis was repeated at different spatial scales by increasing the circular area around each focal woodland, from 2.5 km-radius up to 100 km-radius. Our findings suggest for the first time the geographical scale over which deer management needs to be coordinated for optimum effectiveness in decreasing their impact on woodland across relatively homogenous landscapes. For small bodied and relatively sedentary species (roe deer Capreolus capreolus; Reeves' muntjac Muntiacus reevesi), reductions in impacts within woodlands can be achieved by culling at the immediately local level, but some modest increase in effectiveness (probably relating to reductions in the degree of source-sink movement) may be expected with an increase in spatial scale of culling to around 30–70 km-radius. For larger-bodied, herding species with more extensive home-ranges (fallow deer Dama dama; red deer Cervus elaphus) management for reduction of woodland impacts was only really effective when coordinated above the single woodland-scale, with marked increases shown again up to a scale of 100 km-radius. Whilst future studies for different landscape types are still needed, our work emphasises that the spatial scale at which control plans are conducted can determine the effectiveness of wildlife management, possibly providing an advance on how to manage wildlife populations more effectively.},

   abstract = {In recent decades, grazing by wild and domestic ungulates has become a strategy for conservation management to restore or maintain open landscapes. One of the species playing an increasing role in ecological restoration is the European bison – the largest terrestrial mammal in Europe. We studied the impact of this large herbivore and other ungulates (moose, red deer, and roe deer) on tree encroachment in open habitats in the Białowieża Primeval Forest (Poland). On 30 study plots located in meadows, we measured crown volume and the density of woody vegetation and monitored visitation and behavior of ungulates with the use of camera traps. The mean visitation rate to meadows by European bison was 0.11 ind./day/plot, and 0.22 ind./day/plot by other ungulates. The duration of foraging was significantly higher in European bison (55.8 s) than in other ungulates (16.3 s). The density of woody vegetation on meadows varied from 13 to 6213 ind./ha and the crown volume from 0.6 to 1145 m3/ha. We found that increased visitation by European bison resulted in a significant reduction in the density and volume of woody vegetation in meadows. The reducing effect on woody vegetation was over eight times higher in frequently visited plots when compared to unvisited plots – the density of woody vegetation decreased from 879 to 101 saplings/ha, while the crown volume declined from 295 to 35 m3/ha. In addition, the density of woody vegetation was related to the level of meadow openness. Less open (smaller) meadows had a significantly higher density of woody vegetation than meadows characterized by high openness. Combined visitation by other ungulates did not affect either the volume or density of woody vegetation. The most plausible mechanism of observed patterns can be a remarkably higher foraging activity in meadows by bison in comparison to other ungulates. As a consequence, European bison, being adapted to open habitats, can effectively reduce the growth of tree seedlings and limit tree encroachment at the initial stages of forest succession. Thus, populations of this wild herbivore can play a role in the restoration or maintenance of open habitats and woody pastures that serve as an important foraging ground for bison in suboptimal forests, where populations of these herbivores were restored.},

   abstract = {Abstract Despite increasing reports of severe drought and heat impacts on forest ecosystems, community-level processes, which could potentially modulate tree responses to climatic stress, are rarely accounted for. While numerous studies indicate a positive effect of species diversity on a wide range of ecosystem functions and services, little is known about how species interactions influence tree responses to climatic variability. We quantified the intraspecific variation in 16 leaf and wood physiological, morphological, and anatomical traits in mature beech trees (Fagus sylvatica L.) at six sites located along a climatic gradient in the French Alps. At each site, we studied pure beech and mixed stands with silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) or downy oak (Quercus pubescens Willd.). We tested how functional traits differed between the two species mixtures (pure vs. mixed stands) within each site and along the climatic gradient. We found significant changes in many traits along the climatic gradient as conditions progressively got drier and warmer. Independent of the mixture, reduced leaf-level CO2 assimilation, stomatal size, and thicker leaf cuticles, consistent with a more conservative resource use strategy, were found. At the drier sites, higher foliar stable carbon isotopic composition (δ13C), thicker mesophyll tissues, and lower specific leaf area (SLA) in pure stands suggests that beech had more acquisitive traits there compared to mixed stands. At the wetter sites, trees in beech-silver fir mixtures had higher chlorophyll concentration, lower δ13C, larger xylem vessels, and higher SLA, suggesting a more acquisitive resource use strategy in mixed stands than in pure stands. Our work revealed that species interactions are significant modulators of functional traits, and that they can be just as important drivers of intraspecific trait variation as climatic conditions. We show that downy oak mixtures lead to an adaptive drought response by common beech in dry environments. In contrast, in milder climates, interactions with silver fir seem to increase beech? resource acquisition and productivity. These findings highlight a strong context-dependency and imply that incorporating local interspecific interactions in research on climate impacts could improve our understanding and predictions of forest dynamics.},

   abstract = {The changing forest disturbance regimes emphasize the need for improved damage risk information. Here, our aim was to (1) improve the current understanding of snow damage risks by assessing the importance of abiotic factors, particularly the modelled snow load on trees, versus forest properties in predicting the probability of snow damage, (2) produce a snow damage probability map for Finland. We also compared the results for winters with typical snow load conditions and a winter with exceptionally heavy snow loads. To do this, we used damage observations from the Finnish national forest inventory (NFI) to create a statistical snow damage occurrence model, spatial data layers from different sources to use the model to predict the damage probability for the whole country in 16 x 16 m resolution. Snow damage reports from forest owners were used for testing the final map. Our results showed that best results were obtained when both abiotic and forest variables were included in the model. However, in the case of the high snow load winter, the model with only abiotic predictors performed nearly as well as the full model and the ability of the models to identify the snow damaged stands was higher than in other years. The results showed patterns of forest adaptation to high snow loads, as spruce stands in the north were less susceptible to damage than in southern areas and long-term snow load reduced the damage probability. The model and the derived wall-to-wall map were able to discriminate damage from no-damage cases on a good level (AUC > 0.7). The damage probability mapping approach identifies the drivers of snow disturbances across forest landscapes and can be used to spatially estimate the current and future disturbance probabilities in forests, informing practical forestry and decision-making and supporting the adaptation to the changing disturbance regimes.},

   abstract = {Large mammalian herbivores manifest a strong top-down control on ecosystems that can transform entire landscapes, but their impacts have not been reviewed in the context of terrestrial carbon storage. Here, we evaluate the effects of plant biomass consumption by large mammalian herbivores (>10 kg adult biomass), and the responses of ecosystems to these herbivores, on carbon stocks in temperate and tropical regions, and the Arctic. We calculate the difference in carbon stocks resulting from herbivore exclusion using the results of 108 studies from 52 vegetation types. Our estimates suggest that herbivores can reduce terrestrial above- and below-ground carbon stocks across vegetation types but reductions in carbon stocks may approach zero given sufficient periods of time for systems to respond to herbivory (i.e. decades). We estimate that if all large herbivores were removed from the vegetation types sampled in our review, increases in terrestrial carbon stocks would be up to three orders of magnitude less than many of the natural and human-influenced sources of carbon emissions. However, we lack estimates for the effects of herbivores on below-ground biomass and soil carbon levels in many regions, including those with high herbivore densities, and upwards revisions of our estimates may be necessary. Our results provide a starting point for a discussion on the magnitude of the effects of herbivory on the global carbon cycle, particularly given that large herbivores are common in many ecosystems. We suggest that herbivore removal might represent an important strategy towards increasing terrestrial carbon stocks at local and regional scales within specific vegetation types, since humans influence populations of most large mammals. © 2011 The Authors.

La substitution de la tourbe par ces différents composants affecte de façon très sensible les pro- priétés physico-chimiques du produit résultant. Le substrat apparaît comme un facteur de modula- tion très important du développement racinaire des plants, de leur croissance, ainsi que de leurs caractéristiques photosynthétiques et transpiratoires déterminées à la fin de la période d’élevage. En conditions de fertilisation optimale, les performances de croissance et de photosynthèse maxi- males étaient réalisées avec les substrats TA et TE caractérisés par une aération très favorable. En conditions de fertilisation limitante, les performances des substrats comprenant de l’écorce étaient sensiblement plus faibles que celles de TA, probablement en raison d’une carence azotée induite par la poursuite des processus de minéralisation de fécorce. Le taux de reprise des plants, transplantés à motte intacte, est lié de façon très étroite à leur capacité photosynthétique totale (surface foliaire x taux d’assimilation de C02) mesurée au moment de la transplantation. Cette relation suggère un lien fonctionnel entre la capacité totale instantanée de production d’assimilats et le potentiel de croissance racinaire et de prospection du sol après transplantation. Les résultats montrent l’intérêt de l’utilisation de certains substrats de culture artificiels (dans notre cas TA et TE), ayant des propriétés physico-chimiques plus favorables à la croissance des plants que les substrats classiques à base de terre.

   abstract = {• Key message: Litter trap is considered the most effective method to quantify seed production, but it is expensive and time-consuming. Counting fallen seeds using a quadrat placed on the ground yields comparable estimates to the litter traps. Ground quadrat estimates derived from either visual counting in the field or image counting from quadrat photographs are comparable, with the latter being also robust in terms of user sensitivity. • Context: Accurate estimates of forest seed production are central for a wide range of ecological studies. As reference methods such as litter traps (LT) are cost- and time-consuming, there is a need of fast, reliable, and low-cost tools to quantify this variable in the field. • Aims: To test two indirect methods, which consist of counting the seeds fallen in quadrats. • Methods: The trial was performed in three broadleaved (beech, chestnut, and Turkey oak) tree species. Seeds are either manually counted in quadrats placed at the ground (GQ) or from images acquired in the same quadrats (IQ) and then compared against LT measurements. • Results: GQ and IQ provide fast and reliable estimates of seeds in both oak and chestnut. In particular, IQ is robust in terms of user sensitivity and potentially enables automation in the process of seed monitoring. A null-mast year in beech hindered validation of quadrats in beech. • Conclusion: Quadrat counting is a powerful tool to estimate forest seed production. We recommend using quadrats and LT to cross-calibrate the two methods in case of estimating seed biomass. Quadrats could then be used more routinely on account of their faster and simpler procedure to obtain measurements at more spatially extensive scales.},

   abstract = {There is high variability in the level of herbivory between individual plants from the same species with potential effects on population dynamics, community composition, and ecosystem structure and function. This variability can be partly explained by associational effects (i.e., the impact of the presence of neighboring plants on the level of herbivory experienced by a focal plant) but it is still unclear how the spatial scale of plant neighborhood modulates foraging choice of herbivores, an inherently spatial process in itself. Using a meta-analysis, we investigated how spatial scale modifies associational effects on the susceptibility to browsing by herbivores with movement capacities similar to deer. From 2496 articles found in literature databases, we selected 46 studies providing a total of 168 differences of means in damage by herbivores or survival to woody plants (mostly) with and without neighboring plants. Spatial scales were reported as distance between plants or as plot size. We estimated the relationships between the effect sizes and spatial scale, type of associational effects, and nature of the experiment using meta-analysis mixed models. The strength of associational effects declined with increasing plot size, regardless of the type of associational effects. Associational defenses (i.e., decrease in herbivory for focal plants associated with unpalatable neighbors) had stronger magnitude than associational susceptibilities. The high remaining heterogeneity among studies suggests that untested factors modulate associational effects, such as nutritional quality of focal and neighboring plants, density of herbivores, timing of browsing, etc. Associational effects are already considered in multiple restoration contexts worldwide, but a better understanding of these relationships could improve their use in conservation, restoration, and forest exploitation when browsing is a concern. This study is the first to investigate spatial patterns of associational effects across species and ecosystems, an issue that is essential to determine differential herbivory damages among plants.

   abstract = {A basic idea of plant defences is that a plant should gain protection from its own defence. In addition, there is evidence that defence traits of the neighbouring plants can influence the degree of protection of an individual plant. These associational effects depend in part on the spatial scale of herbivore selectivity. A strong between-patch selectivity together with a weak within-patch selectivity leads to a situation where a palatable plant could avoid being grazed by growing in a patch with unpalatable plants, which is referred to as associational defence. Quite different associational effects will come about if the herbivore instead is unselective between patches and selective within a patch. We studied these effects in a manipulative experiment where we followed the food choice of fallow deer when they encountered two patches of overall different quality. One of the two patches consisted of pellets with low-tannin concentration in seven out of eight buckets and with high concentration in the remaining bucket. The other patch instead had seven high- and one low-tannin bucket. We performed the experiment both with individuals one at a time and with a group of 16-17 deer. We found that the deer were unselective between patches, but selective within a patch, and that the single low-tannin bucket among seven high-tannin buckets was used more than a low-tannin bucket among other low-tannin buckets. This corresponds to a situation where a palatable plant that grows among unpalatable plants is attacked more than if it was growing among its own kind, and for this effect we suggest the term neighbour contrast susceptibility, which is the opposite of associational defence. We also found that the high-tannin bucket in the less defended patch was less used than the high-tannin buckets in the other patch, which corresponds to neighbour contrast defence. The neighbour contrast susceptibility was present both for individual and group foraging, but the strength of the effect was somewhat weaker for groups due to weaker within-patch selectivity. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

   abstract = {This study examined the effect of perceived predation risk imposed by lynx (Lynx lynx) and wolf (Canis lupus) on red deer (Cervus elaphus) foraging behavior under experimental conditions. We hypothesized that in response to large carnivore scent red deer would increase their vigilance, although reducing the frequency and duration of visits to foraging sites. Consequently, browsing intensity on tree saplings was expected to decrease, whereas a higher proportion of more preferred species was expected to be browsed to compensate for higher foraging costs. We expected stronger responses towards the ambush predator lynx, compared with the cursorial predator wolf. These hypotheses were tested in a cafeteria experiment conducted within three red deer enclosures, each containing four experimental plots with olfactory cues of wolf, lynx, cow, and water as control. On each plot, a camera trap was placed and browsing intensity was measured for one consecutive week, repeated three times. Red deer reduced their visitation duration and browsing intensity on plots with large carnivore scent. Despite red deer showing a clear preference for certain tree species, the presence of large carnivore scent did not change selectivity towards different tree species. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found more pronounced effects of wolf (cursorial) compared with lynx (ambush). This study is the first to experimentally assess the perceived risk effects on the red deer foraging behavior of large carnivores differing in hunting modes. Our findings provide insights into the role of olfactory cues in predator–prey interactions and how they can modify fine-scale herbivore–plant interactions.},

Modified freeze-drying, in which leaves were put into a freeze-dryer without being prefrozen, gave concentrations that, for most secondary components, were comparable with those found in fresh leaves. Reducing the freeze-dryer chamber temperature hindered the decomposition of phenolics in prefrozen leaves and in leaves dried without prefreezing. Heat drying induced substantial changes in the composition of all phenolics, except for apigenin-7-glucoside. Vacuum drying at room temperature gave the highest concentrations for nearly all phenolics, while room-drying with desiccation gave results that were comparable with those obtained by fresh leaf analyses.},

Included in winter diets are various species of conifers, some of which are important forestry and ornamental crop trees. Diet choices and feeding habits of mule deer utilizing conifer crops, however, have not been widely reported. Here, we document diet choices made by human-habituated mule deer from north central British Columbia during an exploratory cafeteria-style feeding trial using boughs of thirteen species of native North American and introduced European conifers. Mule deer consumed more biomass from exotic conifers (specifically pine) than from rarely encountered native conifers, and consumed the least biomass from those native conifers commonly encountered by deer in northern BC, a finding which appears to lend support to the Biotic Resistance Hypothesis. From most to least biomass consumed, deer selected Mugho pine, Scots pine, western hemlock, subalpine fir, Douglas fir, Norway spruce, Ponderosa pine, western white pine, lodgepole pine, common juniper, red cedar, black spruce, and hybrid white spruce. Analysis of Variance testing suggested that deer preferred to eat exotic Mugho and Scots pine and avoided eating commonly encountered, native black and hybrid white spruce. A relationship also existed between the biomass consumed and the number of bites taken by deer from each species, which generally indicated that deer took more bites from exotic and rarely encountered conifers, but not always. Our results suggest that northern mule deer, therefore, may be more likely to damage introduced pine and other exotics relative to native species planted in either ornamental or forest plantation settings when deer densities are high and/or browse resources are limited.},

Family-affiliation explained the largest proportion of variance, whereas sample handling had only minor effects. Reducing the taxonomic range increased the impact of differences in sample handling. Additionally, we showed that the concentrations of leaf polyphenols were phylogenetically more conserved than other leaf traits. Non-metric-multi-dimensional scaling revealed similar ordination patterns for leaf polyphenol concentrations in both sample sets with both ordinations being closely correlated. Finally, we computed separate ordinations including an extended set of leaf traits and found that both analyses led to similar ecological conclusions.

In a second experiment the Deer were offered oak, beech (Fagus sylvatica) and sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) in more natural conditions with sparse or dense understory vegetation. The consumption of oak decreased when the understory vegetation was dense; but its availability relative to the other saplings had no effect on the degree of preference.

We correlated winter twig browsing with the concentrations of primary and secondary plant compounds in twigs and new leaves. Furthermore, we investigated 12 specific phenolics in twigs of S. phylicifolia. During winter, moose browsed twigs with low concentrations of phenolic compounds. Additionally, we found significant negative correlations between browsing and the concentration of 7 of the 12 specific phenolic compounds in S. phylicifolia. Most importantly, even though ours was a field study and had many potential sources of variation, a multivariate analysis revealed that these specific phenolics predicted 47% of the variation in moose browsing. The two willows reacted in different chemical ways to moose browsing, but both showed signs of defensive response in early spring and compensation growth in summer. Our data demonstrate the importance of plant secondary chemicals for feeding behaviour of moose and underline the importance of working at a species level in studies of plant-animal interactions, especially with the chemically heterogeneous willows. © 2005 NRC.},

   abstract = {Ungulate browsing has a major impact on the composition and structure of forests. Repeatedly conducted, large-scale regeneration inventories can monitor the extent of browsing pressure and its impacts on forest regeneration development. Based on the respective results, the necessity and extent of wildlife management activities such as hunting, fencing, etc., can be identified at a landscape scale. However, such inventories have rarely been integrated into wildlife management decision making. In this article, we evaluate a regeneration inventory method which was carried out in the Bavarian Forest National Park between 2007 and 2018. We predict the browsing impact by calculating browsing probabilities using a logistic mixed effect model. To provide wildlife managers with feedback on their activities, we developed a test which can assess significant changes in browsing probability between different inventory periods. To find the minimum observable browsing probability change, we simulated ungulate browsing based on the data of a potential browsing indicator species (Sorbus aucuparia) in the National Park. Sorbus aucuparia is evenly distributed, commonly found, selectively browsed and meets the ecosystem development objectives in our study area. We were able to verify a browsing probability change down to ±5 percentage points with a sample size of about 1,000 observations per inventory run. In view of the size of the National Park and the annual fluctuations in browsing pressure, this estimation accuracy seems sufficient. In seeking the maximal cost-efficiency, we were able to reduce this sample size in a sensitivity analysis by about two thirds without severe loss of information for wildlife management. Based on our findings, the presented inventory method combined with our evaluation tool has the potential to be a robust and efficient instrument to assess the impact of herbivores that are in the National Park and other regions.},

   abstract = {Changes in habitat and reduction in predation and hunting pressure are two primary causes of high-density populations of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in many areas of eastern North America. Despite increasing recognition of the major effects deer exert on forest communities, deciding when deer are overabundant remains a major challenge to managers charged with conserving native plant communities. In this context, we define overabundance as a condition where deer are causing the local extinction of a native plant species. Because this definition is difficult to apply from a management perspective, we outline an approach using native understory forbs. Indicator species are selected based on combined criteria of palatability to deer, leaf and flower morphology, and demographic characteristics. Four indices related to plant population viability are derived from understory survey data: flowering rate, mean stem height, stage-class distribution, and deer browsing pressure. We apply this analysis to Trillium populations from forests in Minnesota (highly fragmented agricultural landscape with varying deer densities), Pennsylvania (forested and fragmented landscape with long-term high deer densities), and New York (forested and fragmented landscape with long-term low deer densities). We observed two distinct types of deer-affected plant populations. In sites with moderate or recent increases in deer density, Trillium populations were characterized by low mean plant size, high browsing rates, intermediate flowering rates, and a size class distribution lacking large, reproductive plants. Sites affected by long-term high deer densities exhibited low browsing rates on Trillium, low Trillium flowering rates, a population structure lacking both large and small plants, and high summer browsing pressure on woody saplings. We suggest these combined indices be used to assess deer browsing impact, and we discuss the role of landscape structure and deer density in defining deer overabundance.},

This paper questions whether the current legal framework for game management, which has evolved from early European civilisations to focus on 'hunting rights', is relevant to regulate the contemporary environmental, social and economic dimensions of wild game and their management. Employing a narrative analysis to focus on deer, the study identifies key legislative tenets and highlights the pertinence of historical laws to contemporary conflicts. The analysis suggests that current legislation is increasingly divergent from contemporary trends and has created inertia with respect to sustainable deer management. The paper offers four options to redress this: state intervention; voluntary collaboration; financial incentives; and establishing a legal responsibility for management. It is concluded that significant innovation is required in one or more of these four areas to facilitate the contemporary sustainable management of wild deer in Britain. © 2009 University of Newcastle upon Tyne.},

   abstract = {In recent decades, serious impacts on woodland regeneration have become widespread in Britain as a consequence of increasing numbers of deer. Concern has also been growing about possible effects of deer on the wider ecology of woodland. In April 2000, the Forest Ecology Group of the British Ecological Society held a meeting on 'Ecological Impacts of Deer in Lowland Woods'. This paper summarizes the main issues that emerged from papers presented at that meeting, several of which are published in this special issue of Forestry. The probable causes of the increases in deer populations and the problems posed for deer management are briefly considered. There are convincing reasons to believe that for a wide range of taxa, abundances of particular species and overall community composition can be strongly modified by increasing numbers of deer. Such ecological changes are probably well advanced in many British woods as a result of recent intensified grazing. The general effect of sustained heavy grazing and browsing is a reduction in the richness of biological communities. There are, however, considerable differences among species in their responses and heavy grazing is not detrimental to all species. Responses of many species will be non-linear, with intermediate levels of deer pressure being beneficial in many cases. Ecologists have an important role to play in gaining a better understanding of these effects; this is essential if informed decisions are to be made about deer management at both local and regional levels. However, such research presents many methodological challenges.},

Population size, calves per female, female mean age and adult sex ratio of a moose (Alces alces) population in Vefsn, northern Norway were reconstructed from 1967 to 1993 using cohort analysis and catch-at-age data from 96% (6752) of all individuals harvested. 2. The dynamics of the population were influenced mainly by density-dependent harvesting, stochastic variation in climate and intrinsic variation in the age-structure of the female segment of the population. 3. A time delay in the assignment of hunting permits in relation to population size increased fluctuations in population size. 4. Selective harvesting of calves and yearlings increased the mean age of adult females in the population, and, because fecundity in moose is strongly age-specific, the number of calves per female concordantly increased. However, after years with high recruitment, the adult mean age decreased as large cohorts entered the adult age-groups. This age-structure effect generated cycles in the rate of recruitment to the population and fluctuations introduced time-lags in the population dynamics. 5. An inverse relationship between recruitment rate and population density, mediated by a density-dependent decrease in female body condition, could potentially have constituted a regulatory mechanism in the dynamics of the population, but this effect was counteracted by a density-dependent increase in the mean age of adult females. 6. Stochastic variation in winter snow depth and summer temperature had delayed effects on recruitment rate and in turn population growth rate, apparently through effects on female body condition before conception.},

Forty percent of BPF belongs to Poland, and 60% to the Belarus Republic. Polish and Belarussian game departments inventories of ungulate numbers (1946-1993) and archival data on censuses and hunting statistics (1798-1940) are presented. The recorded ranges of densities of native wild ungulates were: European bison 0-1.5 inds/km2, elk 0-0.6, red deer 0-5.4, roe deer 0.6-4.8, and wild boar 0.2-3.8 inds/km2. Fallow deer were introduced in 1890 (maximum density reached in 1914 was 1.2 inds/km2) and were eradicated by 1920. Cattle were traditionally pastured in the Forest, and its grazing impact was heaviest in 1880-1914 (maximum recorded density 6.7 inds/km2). In 1798-1993, the community of wild ungulates consisted of three to six species, with total densities varying from < 2 to 14.4 inds/km2 (65 to 1180 kg of crude biomass per 1 km2). Roe deer, wild boar, and red deer were usually the dominants. However, in 1860-1971, cattle constituted from 15% to 80% by numbers and from 37% to 87% by biomass of all ungulates in Bialowieza Forest. Data on population trends within a five-species assemblage of native wild ungulates were subject to multiple regression analysis to determine the roles of predation (by wolves Canis lupus and lynxes Lynx lynx), competition, food, weather variables, and humans in shaping population densities and increase rates of ungulates. Growth of the mean annual temperature had positive effect on densities of all ungulates, probably through improving food supply and feeding conditions. Bison and elk were shaped by intra- and interspecific competition for food. Bison numbers have been significantly limited by humans, due to both uncontrolled exploitation in years of political instability and deliberate culling in years of protection. Red deer and roe deer were primarily shaped by predation from wolves and lynx, respectively. Competition for food influenced red and roe deer when they had erupted after predator extermination. Wild boar was influenced predominantly by food availability, especially the highly variable crops of oak seeds.},

   abstract = {A crucial element in the “the landscape of fear” concept is that prey animals are aware of varying levels of predation risk at a spatial scale. This often leads to a negative spatial relationship between prey and predator in which prey avoid the most risky sites in the landscape. In this paper, we argue that our understanding of large carnivore-ungulate interactions is biased by studies from highly heterogeneous landscapes (e.g. the Yellowstone National Park). Due to a high availability of refuges and foraging sites in such landscapes, prey are able to reduce predation risk by showing habitat shifts. Besides the spatial heterogeneity at the landscape scale, the ungulate response to predation risk can be affected by the hunting mode (stalking vs. cursorial) of the predator. We propose that prey cannot easily avoid predation risk by moving to less risky habitats in more homogenous landscapes with concentrated food resources, especially where the large carnivores’ assemblage includes both stalking and cursorial species. No distinct refuges for prey may occur in such landscapes due to equally high accessibility to predators in all habitats, while concentrated resources make prey distribution more predictable. We discuss a model of a densely forested landscape based on a case study of the Białowieża Primeval Forest, Poland. Within this landscape, ungulates focus their foraging activity on small food-rich forest gaps, which turn out to be “death traps” as the gaps are primarily targeted by predators (stalking lynx and cursorial wolf) while hunting. No alternative of moving to low predation risk areas exist for prey due to risk from wolves in surrounding closed-canopy forest. As a result, the prey is exposed to constant high predation pressure in contrast to heterogeneous landscapes with less concentrated resources and more refuge areas. Future research should focus on explaining how ungulates are coping with predation risk in these landscapes that offer little choice of escaping predation by considering behavioural and physiological (e.g. metabolic, hormonal) responses.},

   abstract = {Large carnivores can either directly influence ungulate populations or indirectly affect their behaviour. Knowledge from European systems, in contrast to North American systems, on how this might lead to cascading effects on lower trophic levels is virtually absent. We studied whether wolves Canis lupus via density-mediated and behaviorally-mediated effects on their ungulate prey species influence patterns of browsing and tree regeneration inside the Bialowieża National Park, Poland. Browsing intensity of tree saplings (height class < 150 cm), irrespective of tree species or forest type, was lower inside a wolf core area (50.5%) where predator presence is highest, than in the remainder of the wolf pack's home range (58.3%). Additionally, browsing intensity was reduced when the amount of coarse woody debris (CWD), which can act as a 'ungulate escape impediment', increased (within 5-m radius) inside the wolf core area. No relationship existed outside the core area. As a result, the proportion of trees growing out of herbivore control increased more strongly with increasing amount of CWD inside compared to outside the wolf core area. This suggests that next to direct effects of wolves on ungulate density caused by a higher predation pressure inside the core area, risk effects are important and are enhanced by habitat characteristics. These results indicate that behaviorally-mediated effects of predators on prey can become more important than density-mediated effects in affecting lower trophic levels. This is the first study we are aware of, that shows CWD can create fine-scale risk effects on ungulates with the potential for cascading effects of large predators on patterns of tree regeneration for a European forest system. This knowledge broadens the discussion on how the impact of large predators on ecosystem functioning depends on the physical landscape, by illustrating these effects for a system which largely contrasts in this respect to the North American systems. © 2013 The Authors.},

   abstract = {Non-consumptive effects of predators result from the cost of responses to perceived risk. Prey modulate risk exposure through flexible habitat selection at multiple scales which, in interaction with landscape constraints, determines their use of risky habitats. Identifying the relative contributions of landscape constraints and habitat selection to risk exposure is a critical first step towards a mechanistic understanding of non-consumptive effects. Here, we provide an integrative multi-scale study of roe deer spatial responses to variable hunting pressure along a landscape gradient of open habitats and dispersed refuges. Between low-risk and high-risk periods, we investigated shifts in 1) home-range location, 2) probability of using risky habitats (between-habitat scale) and 3) distance to the nearest refuge (within-habitat scale). For 2) and 3), we disentangled the contributions of landscape constraints and habitat selection to risky habitat use. We found that when risk was high, roe deer did not shift their home-range, but generally decreased their use of risky habitats, and sometimes reduced their distance to cover (particularly older animals). There was a functional response in between-habitat selection, with animals living in more open landscapes responding more than those living in landscapes with more refuges. However, individuals living in more open landscapes avoided open risky habitat less. Finally, we found that among-individual variation in risk exposure was generally, but not always, minimized by habitat selection across gradients of landscape constraints. To our knowledge, this is the first study simultaneously documenting prey responses to risk at the within-habitat, between-habitat and home-range scales. Our results support the view that between-habitat selection acts at a higher hierarchical level than within-habitat selection, and provide a framework for disentangling the contributions of habitat selection and landscape constraints to risk exposure. Selection cannot always compensate for landscape constraints, indicating a need for further investigation of the processes underlying habitat selection.},

   abstract = {The value of non-commodity ecosystem services provided by forests is widely recognized, but intensive forest management practices are increasing, with uncertain consequences for a multitude of these services. Quantitative relationships among biodiversity conservation, timber production and other ecosystem services remain poorly understood, especially during the early-successional period of intensively managed forestlands. We manipulated management intensity in regenerating forest plantations to test the prediction that treatments aimed at maximizing timber production decrease biodiversity conservation and non-timber services. We measured species richness of 3 taxonomic groups and 13 proxies for provisioning, cultural and regulating services within stands randomly assigned to one of the three herbicide application intensities or an untreated control. Herbicides increased allocation of net primary production to crop trees, increasing projected timber volume and revenues at 40- and 60-year harvest ages. Commonly used herbicide prescriptions reduced culturally valued plants by 71%, wild-ungulate forage by 41%, avian richness by 20% and pollinator floral resources by 42%, the latter being associated with 38% fewer pollinator species. However, agriculturally valued bumblebees, pollination of blueberries, avian-mediated arthropod control, wild ungulate observations and regulation services tied to forest productivity appeared unaffected by increasing management intensity and timber production. Species richness and flora-provided services in young forest plantations exhibited strong trade-offs with projected timber production, whereas post-treatment vegetation regeneration and site-level variation likely maintained a range of other services. Although vegetation recovery is important for supporting wildlife and some ecosystem services on industrial forestlands, it is unlikely that any single prescription can optimize both timber and non-timber benefits to society across managed forest landscapes. Instead, producing different services in discrete portions of the landscape may be necessary. Synthesis and applications. We tested the effects of intensive forest management via herbicides on ecosystem services and found that biodiversity responses and services from early-successional vegetation trade-off against timber production. A number of services appeared to be compatible with timber production, although no single prescription optimized the full range of services. Stand-level biodiversity conservation and a variety of services could potentially be provided by treatment skips and less-intensive management on productive sites, although it is unlikely that all services can be optimized without landscape-level planning.},

   abstract = {Land-use intensification can increase provisioning ecosystem services, such as food and timber production, but it also drives changes in ecosystem functioning and biodiversity loss, which may ultimately compromise human wellbeing. To understand how changes in land-use intensity affect the relationships between biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and services, we built networks from correlations between the species richness of 16 trophic groups, 10 ecosystem functions, and 15 ecosystem services. We evaluated how the properties of these networks varied across land-use intensity gradients for 150 forests and 150 grasslands. Land-use intensity significantly affected network structure in both habitats. Changes in connectance were larger in forests, while changes in modularity and evenness were more evident in grasslands. Our results show that increasing land-use intensity leads to more homogeneous networks with less integration within modules in both habitats, driven by the belowground compartment in grasslands, while forest responses to land management were more complex. Land-use intensity strongly altered hub identity and module composition in both habitats, showing that the positive correlations of provisioning services with biodiversity and ecosystem functions found at low land-use intensity levels, decline at higher intensity levels. Our approach provides a comprehensive view of the relationships between multiple components of biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and ecosystem services and how they respond to land use. This can be used to identify overall changes in the ecosystem, to derive mechanistic hypotheses, and it can be readily applied to further global change drivers.},

In the winter of 1994–1995, wolves were reintroduced into parts of Yellowstone National Park. Foraging theory predicts that elk and bison would respond to this threat by in- creasing their vigilance levels. We tested this prediction by comparing vigilance levels of elk and bison in areas with wolves with those of elk still in “wolf-free” zones of the Park. Male elk and bison showed no response to the reintro- duction of wolves, maintaining the lowest levels of vigilance throughout the study (≈12 and 7% of the time was spent vigilant, respectively). Female elk and bison showed significantly higher vigilance levels in areas with wolves than in areas without wolves. The highest vigilance level (47.5 ± 4.1%; mean ± SE) was seen by the second year for female elk with calves in the areas with wolves and was maintained during the subsequent 3 years of the study. As wolves ex- panded into non-wolf areas, female elk with and without calves in these areas gradually increased their vigilance levels from initially 20.1 ± 3.5 and 11.5 ± 0.9% to 43.0 ± 5.9 and 30.5 ± 2.8% by the fifth year of the study, respectively. We discuss the possible reasons for the differences seen among the social groups. We suggest that these behavioural re- sponses to the presence of wolves may have more far-reaching consequences for elk and bison ecology than the actual killing of individuals by wolves.},

We introduce the concept of 'hunting for fear' as an extension of the more classical 'hunting to kill' that is typically used in large herbivore management. Hunting for fear aims to induce a behavioural response in ungulates, for example, as a way of diverting them from areas where their impact is undesired. Synthesis and applications. Hunting for fear asks for novel, potentially controversial, ways of hunting to induce strong enough risk effects, including more hunting on foot and with dogs, extended hunting seasons (ideally year-round) and increased hunting of calves. Hunting for fear may offer novel opportunities to help manage the growing human-wildlife conflicts that we experience globally. © 2013 The Authors.

   abstract = {“Predation risk” and “fear” are concepts well established in animal behavior literature. We expand these concepts to develop the model of the “landscape of fear”. The landscape of fear represents relative levels of predation risk as peaks and valleys that reflect the level of fear of predation a prey experiences in different parts of its area of use. We provide observations in support of this model regarding changes in predation risk with respect to habitat types, and terrain characteristics. We postulate that animals have the ability to learn and can respond to differing levels of predation risk. We propose that the landscape of fear can be quantified with the use of well documented existing methods such as giving- up densities, vigilance observations, and foraging surveys of plants. We conclude that the landscape of fear is a useful visual model and has the potential to become a unifying ecological concept.},

Animal responses are manifold (immediate and/or delayed, short and/or long-lasting, with numerous behaviors affected) so that comprehensive studies are few. Here, we contrasted days with low or high tourism or hunting pressures to assess direct (daytime) and indirect (nighttime) responses of 66 GPS-collared Mediterranean mouflon Ovis gmelini musimon×. Ovis sp. from the Caroux-Espinouse massif (southern France) in terms of movement, habitat use and daily activity. We took advantage of the fact that both human activities occurred during different periods and with different intensities in 3 contiguous areas (among which a protected area without hunting and with limited tourism) to compare their influence on mouflon behavior. Mouflon response to tourism was limited to the area where tourism pressure was intense with a decrease in diurnal activity compensated during nighttime by an increase of nocturnal activity. Hunting had marked consequences in the two hunted areas, with a similar shift in activity between day and night, a decrease in movement sinuosity during daytime by females and an increase in nocturnal use of the best foraging habitats by males, all suggesting an increase in foraging activities during nights following disturbance. The diurnal activity of mouflon living in the protected area was also modified during hunting period, but without nocturnal compensation. These findings revealed that the impact of hunting was higher than tourism, with several components of animal behavior affected. This calls for further research on hunting side-effects in terms of disturbance, especially as it occurs during both the adverse climatic season and the breeding period. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Predators generate a ''landscape of fear'' within which prey can minimize the risk of predation by selecting low-risk areas. Depending on the spatial structure of this ''landscape'', i.e., whether it is coarse-or fine-grained, prey may respond to increased risk by shifting their home ranges or by fine-scale redistributions within these ranges, respectively. We studied how wild boar (Sus scrofa L., 1758) responded to temporal changes in risk in hunted areas (risky habitat) sur-rounding a nature reserve (refuge habitat). Animals with home ranges ''in contact'' with the reserve during the low-risk season were the only ones to shift toward the refuge when the risk increased. These shifts occurred at two temporal scales in response to the increased risk during the daytime and during the hunting season. Whereas animals not influenced by the reserve found food and shelter in forest during the hunting season, shifts to the refuge area were detrimental to the rather scarce forest areas in the reserve. This confirms that spatiotemporal changes in risk are major drivers of animal distribution when predation strongly limits their fitness. Their response is, however, scale-dependent and reflects at the individual level the perceived structure of their ''landscape of fear''.},

   abstract = {Traditional woodland management created a mosaic of differently aged patches providing favorable conditions for a variety of arthropods. After abandonment of historical ownership patterns and traditional management and the deliberate transformation to high forest after World War II, large forest areas became darker and more homogeneous. This had significant negative consequences for biodiversity. An important question is whether even smallscale habitat structures maintained by different levels of canopy openness in abandoned coppiced forest may constitute conditions suitable for forest as well as open habitat specialists. We investigated the effect of canopy openness in former traditionally coppiced woodlands on the species richness, functional diversity, activity density, conservation value, and degree of rareness of epigeic spiders. In each of the eight studied locations, 60-m-long transect was established consisting of five pitfall traps placed at regular 15 m intervals along the gradient. Spiders were collected from May to July 2012. We recorded 90 spider species, including high proportions of xeric specialists (40%) and red-listed threatened species (26%). The peaks of conservation indicators, as well as spider community abundance, were shifted toward more open canopies. On the other hand, functional diversity peaked at more closed canopies followed by a rapid decrease with increasing canopy openness. Species richness was highest in the middle of the canopy openness gradient, suggesting an ecotone effect. Ordinations revealed that species of conservation concern tended to be associated with sparse and partly opened canopy. The results show that the various components of biodiversity peaked at different levels of canopy openness. Therefore, the restoration and suitable forest management of such conditions will retain important diversification of habitats in formerly coppiced oak forest stands. We indicate that permanent presence of smallscale improvements could be suitable conservation tools to prevent the general decline of woodland biodiversity in the intensified landscape of Central Europe.},

We focused on the situation when an oak woodland is still partly managed as an ancient game park and partly abandoned as a nature conservation amendment. We studied this effect using a multi-taxa approach with lichens, fungi and beetles and investigated their response to the changing patterns in canopy openness, dead wood distribution and host tree conditions. The study was done in the Hradec Králové region of the Czech Republic. We found that the maintenance of canopy openness, as determined by management, was the primary driver influencing species composition. Canopy closure led to homogenization of the beetle and lichen communities and the loss of species. Fungi were mainly driven by the amount of dead wood, and abandonment favored their species richness. The creation of a new wilderness was only profitable for fungi, and the maintenance of canopy openness was an important driver for most of the studied taxa (i.e., biodiversity maintenance). Canopy openness and the presence of veteran trees could be used as an indicator of a management history that helps conserve biodiversity. Appropriate conditions for all taxa studied could be fulfilled using wood pasturing or game keeping in combination with dead tree retention.},

   abstract = {Competition effects and management related disturbances can contribute to strong non-climatic signals in ring-width trends of trees from closed canopy forests. Removing this noise comes at the price of losing a considerable amount of (climatic) information on decadal and centennial time scales. Alternatively, open grown solitary trees, which never competed for light or other resources could function as less biased climate proxies. To explore this potential we analysed individual growth trends and climate-growth relationships of solitary oaks, potentially representative of former, open forests, and compared it to those of trees growing in adjacent closed canopy forests. Solitary oaks show differing tree allometry with bigger crowns and lower absolute heights. Their radial growth was significantly higher compared to forest trees. Contrary to our expectations, these solitary oaks show highly individualistic decadal growth trends. Their inter-annual variations are nevertheless in good agreement between individuals and stronger compared to trees from closed canopy forests. Climate –growth analysis revealed a significantly higher drought sensitivity of solitary oaks. Given the typical open medieval forest structure of large trees with extensive crowns growing in a mosaic of grazed woodlands and grasslands, it is likely that these trees contribute to the historical part of tree-ring collections. When trees from today's denser forests forming the recent parts of the collections are used to calibrate reconstruction models, the differing drought sensitivity might therefore lead to an overestimation of historical droughts.},

   abstract = {The successional dynamics of forests—from canopy openings to regeneration, maturation, and decay—influence the amount and heterogeneity of resources available for forest-dwelling organisms. Conservation has largely focused only on selected stages of forest succession (e.g., late-seral stages). However, to develop comprehensive conservation strategies and to understand the impact of forest management on biodiversity, a quantitative understanding of how different trophic groups vary over the course of succession is needed. We classified mixed mountain forests in Central Europe into nine successional stages using airborne LiDAR. We analysed α- and β-diversity of six trophic groups encompassing approximately 3,000 species from three kingdoms. We quantified the effect of successional stage on the number of species with and without controlling for species abundances and tested whether the data fit the more-individuals hypothesis or the habitat heterogeneity hypothesis. Furthermore, we analysed the similarity of assemblages along successional development. The abundance of producers, first-order consumers, and saprotrophic species showed a U-shaped response to forest succession. The number of species of producer and consumer groups generally followed this U-shaped pattern. In contrast to our expectation, the number of saprotrophic species did not change along succession. When we controlled for the effect of abundance, the number of producer and saproxylic beetle species increased linearly with forest succession, whereas the U-shaped response of the number of consumer species persisted. The analysis of assemblages indicated a large contribution of succession-mediated β-diversity to regional γ-diversity. Synthesis and applications. Depending on the species group, our data supported both the more-individuals hypothesis and the habitat heterogeneity hypothesis. Our results highlight the strong influence of forest succession on biodiversity and underline the importance of controlling for successional dynamics when assessing biodiversity change in response to external drivers such as climate change. The successional stages with highest diversity (early and late successional stages) are currently strongly underrepresented in the forests of Central Europe. We thus recommend that conservation strategies aim at a more balanced representation of all successional stages.},

Here, we examine the ability of reflectance spectroscopy to quantify specific phenolic compounds in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and paper birch (Betula papyrifera) that play influential roles in ecosystem functioning related to trophic-level interactions and nutrient cycling. Spectral measurements on live aspen and birch leaves were collected, after which concentrations of condensed tannins (aspen and birch) and salicinoids (aspen only) were determined using standard analytical approaches in the laboratory. Predictive models were then constructed using jackknifed, partial least squares regression (PLSR). Model performance was evaluated using coefficient of determination (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE) and the per cent RMSE of the data range (%RMSE). Condensed tannins of aspen and birch were well predicted from both combined (R2 = 0·86, RMSE = 2·4, %RMSE = 7%)- and individual-species models (aspen: R2 = 0·86, RMSE = 2·4, %RMSE = 6%; birch: R2 = 0·81, RMSE = 1·9, %RMSE = 10%). Aspen total salicinoids were better predicted than individual salicinoids (total: R2 = 0·76, RMSE = 2·4, %RMSE = 8%; salicortin: R2 = 0·57, RMSE = 1·9, %RMSE = 11%; tremulacin: R2 = 0·72, RMSE = 1·1, %RMSE = 11%), and spectra collected from dry leaves produced better models for both aspen tannins (R2 = 0·92, RMSE = 1·7, %RMSE = 5%) and salicinoids (R2 = 0·84, RMSE = 1·4, %RMSE = 5%) compared with spectra from fresh leaves. The decline in prediction performance from total to individual salicinoids and from dry to fresh measurements was marginal, however, given the increase in detailed salicinoid information acquired and the time saved by avoiding drying and grinding leaf samples. Reflectance spectroscopy can successfully characterize specific secondary metabolites in living plant tissue and provide detailed information on individual compounds within a constituent group. The ability to simultaneously measure multiple plant traits is a powerful attribute of reflectance spectroscopy because of its potential for in situ–in vivo field deployment using portable spectrometers. The suite of traits currently estimable, however, needs to expand to include specific secondary metabolites that play influential roles in ecosystem functioning if we are to advance the integration of chemical, landscape and ecosystem ecology.},

We showed that, using a classification approach, it was possible to discriminate thick from thin pericarp whole grain samples with a good accuracy and that the proportion of thin and thick grains in mixed samples could also be predicted. In addition, pericarp thickness had a significant effect on the calibration performance for other grain parameters indicating that the pericarp can distort spectral information of whole grain samples. As a practical consequence, we suggest to develop separate whole grain calibration models for thin and thick pericarp samples, combined with a two-steps prediction approach to improve the accuracy of whole grain NIRS calibrations for grain quality parameters in sorghum.},

To develop resilience-based forest management, new tools and methods are needed to quantitatively estimate forest resilience to management and future natural disturbances. We propose a multidimensional evaluation of ecological resilience based on species functional response traits (e.g., functional response diversity and functional redundancy) and network properties of forested patches (e.g., connectivity, modularity, and centrality). Using a fragmented rural landscape in temperate south-eastern Canada as a reference landscape, we apply our multidimensional approach to evaluate two alternative management strategies at three levels of intensity: (1) functional enrichment of current forest patches and (2) multi-species plantations in previously non-forested patches. Within each management strategy, planted species are selected to maximize functional diversity, drought tolerance, or pest resistance. We further compare how ecological resilience under these alternative management strategies responds to three simulated disturbances: drought, pest outbreak, and timber harvesting. We found that both management strategies enhance resilience at the landscape scale by increasing functional response diversity and connectivity. Specifically, when the less functionally diverse patches are prioritized for management, functional enrichment is more effective than the establishment of new multi-species plantations in increasing resilience. In addition, randomly allocated multi-species plantations increased connectivity more than those allocated in riparian areas. Our results show that across various management strategies, planting species to enhance biodiversity led to the highest increase in functional response diversity while planting pest-resistant species led to the highest increase in landscape connectivity. Planting biodiversity-enhancing species (i.e., species that maximize functional diversity) mitigated drought effects equally well as planting with drought-tolerant species. Our multidimensional approach facilitates the characterization at the landscape scale of forest resilience to disturbances using both functional diversity and network properties while accounting for the importance of response traits to future disturbances. The simulation approach we used can be applied to forest landscapes across different biomes for the evaluation and comparison of forest management initiatives to enhance resilience.},

   abstract = {Biological insurance theory predicts that, in a variable environment, aggregate ecosystem properties will vary less in more diverse communities because declines in the performance or abundance of some species or phenotypes will be offset, at least partly, by smoother declines or increases in others. During the past two decades, ecology has accumulated strong evidence for the stabilising effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning. As biological insurance is reaching the stage of a mature theory, it is critical to revisit and clarify its conceptual foundations to guide future developments, applications and measurements. In this review, we first clarify the connections between the insurance and portfolio concepts that have been used in ecology and the economic concepts that inspired them. Doing so points to gaps and mismatches between ecology and economics that could be filled profitably by new theoretical developments and new management applications. Second, we discuss some fundamental issues in biological insurance theory that have remained unnoticed so far and that emerge from some of its recent applications. In particular, we draw a clear distinction between the two effects embedded in biological insurance theory, i.e. the effects of biodiversity on the mean and variability of ecosystem properties. This distinction allows explicit consideration of trade-offs between the mean and stability of ecosystem processes and services. We also review applications of biological insurance theory in ecosystem management. Finally, we provide a synthetic conceptual framework that unifies the various approaches across disciplines, and we suggest new ways in which biological insurance theory could be extended to address new issues in ecology and ecosystem management. Exciting future challenges include linking the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and stability, incorporating multiple functions and feedbacks, developing new approaches to partition biodiversity effects across scales, extending biological insurance theory to complex interaction networks, and developing new applications to biodiversity and ecosystem management.},

   abstract = {The perfect-plasticity approximation (PPA) is an analytically tractable model of forest dynamics, defined in terms of parameters for individual trees, including allometry, growth, and mortality. We estimated these parameters for the eight most common species on each of four soil types in the US Lake states (Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota) by using short-term (≤15-year) inventory data from individual trees. We implemented 100-year PPA simulations given these parameters and compared these predictions to chronosequences of stand development. Predictions for the timing and magnitude of basal area dynamics and ecological succession on each soil were accurate, and predictions for the diameter distribution of 100-year-old stands were correct in form and slope. For a given species, the PPA provides analytical metrics for early-successional performance (H20, height of a 20-year-old open-grown tree) and late-successional performance (Ẑ *, equilibrium canopy height in monoculture). These metrics predicted which species were early or late successional on each soil type. Decomposing Ẑ * showed that (i) succession is driven both by superior understory performance and superior canopy performance of late-successional species, and (ii) performance differences primarily reflect differences in mortality rather than growth. The predicted late-successional dominants matched chronosequences on xeromesic (Quercus rubra) and mesic (codominance by Acer rubrum and Acer saccharum) soil. On hydromesic and hydric soils, the literature reports that the current dominant species in old stands (Thuja occidentalis) is now failing to regenerate. Consistent with this, the PPA predicted that, on these soils, stands are now succeeding to dominance by other late-successional species (e.g., Fraxinus nigra, A. rubrum). © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

Two indicators of tree diversity associated with ecosystem functioning have recently received particular attention in the literature: functional redundancy (FR) and response diversity (RD). We examined how these indicators could be used to predict post-logging productivity in forests of Québec, Canada. We analysed the relationships between pre-logging FR and RD, as measured with sample plots, and post-logging productivity, measured as seasonal variation in enhanced vegetation index obtained from MODIS satellite imagery. The effects of the deciduous and coniferous tree components in our pre-disturbance diversity assessments were isolated in order to examine the hypothesis that they have different impacts on post-disturbance productivity. We also examined the role of tree species richness and species identity effects. Our analysis revealed the complementary nature of traditional biodiversity indicators and trait-based approaches in the study of biodiversity–ecosystem-functioning relationships in dynamic ecosystems. We report a significant and positive relationship between pre-disturbance deciduous RD and post-disturbance productivity, as well as an unexpected significant negative effect of coniferous RD on productivity. This negative relationship with post-logging productivity likely results from slower coniferous regeneration speeds and from the relatively short temporal scale examined. Negative black-spruce-mediated identity effects were likely associated with increased stand vulnerability to paludification and invasion by ericaceous shrubs that slow down forest regeneration. Response diversity outperformed functional redundancy as a measure of post-disturbance productivity most likely due to the stand-replacing nature of the disturbance considered. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies to report a negative significant relationship between a component of RD and ecosystem functioning, namely coniferous RD and forest ecosystem productivity after a stand-replacing disturbance.},

Ecologists have long argued about multiple mechanisms by which local biodiversity might control the temporal stability of ecosystem properties. Accumulating theories and empirical evidence suggest that, together with different population and community parameters, these mechanisms largely operate through differences in functional traits among organisms. We review potential trait-stability mechanisms together with underlying tests and associated metrics. We identify various trait-based components, each accounting for different stability mechanisms, that contribute to buffering, or propagating, the effect of environmental fluctuations on ecosystem functioning. This comprehensive picture, obtained by combining different puzzle pieces of trait-stability effects, will guide future empirical and modeling investigations.},

In Europe, storms and fires have been identified as the most important abiotic disturbances in the recent past. Yet, how strongly these agents drive local disturbance regimes compared to other agents (e.g., biotic, human) remains unresolved. Furthermore, whether storms and fires are responsible for the observed increase in forest disturbances in Europe is debated. Here, we provide quantitative evidence for the prevalence of storm and fire disturbances in Europe 1986–2016. For 27 million disturbance patches mapped from satellite data, we determined whether they were caused by storm or fire, using a random forest classifier and a large reference dataset of true disturbance occurrences. We subsequently analyzed patterns of disturbance prevalence (i.e., the share of an agent on the overall area disturbed) in space and time. Storm- and fire-related disturbances each accounted for approximately 7% of all disturbances recorded in Europe in the period 1986–2016. Storm-related disturbances were most prevalent in western and central Europe, where they locally accounted for >50% of all disturbances, but we also identified storm-related disturbances in south-eastern and eastern Europe. Fire-related disturbances were a major disturbance agent in southern and south-eastern Europe, but fires also occurred in eastern and northern Europe. The prevalence and absolute area of storm-related disturbances increased over time, whereas no trend was detected for fire-related disturbances. Overall, we estimate an average of 127,716 (97,680–162,725) ha of storm-related disturbances per year and an average of 141,436 (107,353–181,022) ha of fire-related disturbances per year. We conclude that abiotic disturbances caused by storm and fire are important drivers of forest dynamics in Europe, but that their influence varies substantially by region. Our analysis further suggests that increasing storm-related disturbances are an important driver of Europe's changing forest disturbance regimes.},

Although the importance of size structure for demography is widely recognized, many models either omit it entirely or include only coarse approximations. Here, we introduce the plant package, an extensible framework for modelling size- and trait-structured demography, ecology and evolution in simulated forests. At its core, plant is an individual-based model where plant physiology and demography are mediated by traits. Individual plants from multiple species can be grown in isolation, in patches of competing plants or in metapopulations under a disturbance regime. These dynamics can be integrated into metapopulation-level estimates of invasion fitness and vegetation structure. Because fitness emerges as a function of traits, plant provides a novel arena for exploring eco-evolutionary dynamics. plant is an open source R package and is available at github.com/traitecoevo/plant. Accessed from R, the core routines in plant are written in C++. The package provides for alternative physiologies and for capturing trade-offs among parameters. A detailed test suite is provided to ensure correct behaviour of the code. plant provides a transparent platform for investigating how physiological rules and functional trade-offs interact with competition and disturbance regimes to influence vegetation demography, structure and diversity.},

Population dynamic models provide insight into the different routes by which range limits can arise owing to gradients in demographic rates. In a metapopulation context, for example, range limits may be caused by gradients in extinction rates, colonization rates or habitat availability. We have consider invasion models in uniform and heterogeneous environments as a framework for understanding non-equilibrium range limits, and explore conditions under which invasions may cease to spread leaving behind a stationary range limit.

In this paper, we report the development of a new, empirical method of simultaneously estimating both local storm severity and the parameters of functions that define species-specific variation in susceptibility to windthrow as a function of storm severity and tree size. We test the method using data collected following a storm that struck the western Adirondack Mountains of New York in 1995. For intermediate-sized stems (e.g., 40 cm DBH), black cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh.) and red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) showed the highest rates of windthrow across virtually all levels of storm severity, while yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) had the lowest rates of windthrow. For much of the range of storm severity, the probability of windthrow for the most susceptible species was at least twice as high as for the least susceptible species. Three of the species, yellow birch, red spruce, and beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.), had significantly lower probability of windthrow at a given storm severity in old-growth stands than in second-growth stands. Our results suggest that the distinctive abundance of these three species in old-growth forests of the Adirondacks is due, at least in part, to their ability to survive the intermediate-scale disturbance events that appear to dominate the natural disturbance regime in this region.},

   abstract = {The ecological niche of a species describes the variation in population growth rates along environmental gradients that drives geographic range dynamics. Niches are thus central for understanding and forecasting species’ geographic distributions. However, theory predicts that migration limitation, source–sink dynamics, and time-lagged local extinction can cause mismatches between niches and geographic distributions. It is still unclear how relevant these niche–distribution mismatches are for biodiversity dynamics and how they depend on species life-history traits. This is mainly due to a lack of the comprehensive, range-wide demographic data needed to directly infer ecological niches for multiple species. Here we quantify niches from extensive demographic measurements along environmental gradients across the geographic ranges of 26 plant species (Proteaceae; South Africa). We then test whether life history explains variation in species’ niches and niche–distribution mismatches. Niches are generally wider for species with high seed dispersal or persistence abilities. Life-history traits also explain the considerable interspecific variation in niche–distribution mismatches: poorer dispersers are absent from larger parts of their potential geographic ranges, whereas species with higher persistence ability more frequently occupy environments outside their ecological niche. Our study thus identifies major demographic and functional determinants of species’ niches and geographic distributions. It highlights that the inference of ecological niches from geographical distributions is most problematic for poorly dispersed and highly persistent species. We conclude that the direct quantification of ecological niches from demographic responses to environmental variation is a crucial step toward a better predictive understanding of biodiversity dynamics under environmental change.},

In these models, uncertainty in the description of demographic processes, in particular tree mortality, is a persistent problem. Current mortality formulations lack realism and are insufficiently constrained by empirical evidence. It has been suggested that empirically estimated mortality submodels would enhance DVM performance, but due to the many processes and interactions within a DVM, the claim has rarely been tested. Here, we compare the performance of three alternative growth-dependent tree mortality submodels in the DVM ForClim: (1) a mortality function with theoretical foundation (ForClim v3.3); (2) a mortality function with parameters directly estimated based on forest inventory data; and (3) the same function, but with parameters estimated using an inverse approach through Bayesian calibration (BC). Time series of inventory data from 30 ecologically distinct Swiss natural forest reserves collected over 35+ yr, including the main tree species of Central Europe, were used for the calibration and subsequent validation of the mortality functions and the DVM. The recalibration resulted in mortality parameters that differed from the direct empirical estimates, particularly for the relationship between tree size and mortality. The calibrated parameters outperformed the direct estimates, and to a lesser extent the original mortality function, for predicting decadal-scale forest dynamics at both calibration and validation sites. The same pattern was observed regarding the plausibility of their long-term projections under contrasting environmental conditions. Our results demonstrate that inverse calibration may be useful even when direct empirical estimates of DVM parameters are available, as structural model deficiencies or data problems can result in discrepancies between direct and inverse estimates. Thus, we interpret the good performance of the inversely calibrated model for long-term projections (which were not a calibration target) as evidence that the calibration did not compensate for model errors. Rather, we surmise that the discrepancy was mainly caused by a lack of representativeness of the mortality data. Our results underline the potential for learning more about elusive processes, such as tree mortality or recruitment, through data integration in DVMs.},

Dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) used to predict forest dynamics are typically based on simple, largely data-free (‘theoretical’) mortality algorithms (MAs). To improve DVM projections, the use of empirically based MAs has been suggested, but little is known about their impact on DVM behavior. A systematic comparison of eight MAs (seven inventory-based, one ‘theoretical’) for the pan-European tree species Pinus sylvestris L. was carried out within the DVM ForClim for present and future climate scenarios at three contrasting sites across Europe. Model accuracy was furthermore evaluated with empirical data from young- and old-growth forests. We found strongly diverging mortality patterns among the MAs for present climate. Based on their behavior, we identified two distinct empirical MA groups that were related to their structure (i.e., variables considered), but not to their geographic origin (i.e., the environmental conditions they were calibrated to). Under climate change, MAs based on a competition index produced ecologically inconsistent results, while MAs based on growth showed more plausible and less extreme behaviors. Furthermore, MAs based on growth reached a higher accuracy for projecting young- and old-growth forest dynamics. Our results demonstrate that using empirical MAs in DVMs has a high potential to better predict forest dynamics, but also a risk of yielding implausible results if their structure is inadequate. For DVM applications across large spatiotemporal scales, we thus suggest using MAs based on growth, particularly under future no-analogue climates.},

   abstract = {To facilitate forest transition to future climate conditions, managers can use adaptive silvicultural tools, for example the assisted translocation of tree species and genotypes to areas with suitable future climate conditions (i.e., assisted migration). Like traditional plantations, however, assisted migration plantations are at risk of failure because of browsing by ungulate herbivores. The ability of seedlings to tolerate browsing could also be hampered by low water availability, as is expected under climate change. Using a greenhouse experiment with five eastern North American tree species, we evaluated the effects of simulated winter browsing and reduced water availability on the growth (total biomass, shoot:root ratio), survival, and chemical composition (nitrogen, total phenolics, flavonoids) of seedlings. We compared seedlings from three geographic provenances representing three climate analogues, i.e., locations with a current climate similar to the climate predicted at the plantation site at a specific time (here: current, mid-century and end of the century). We hypothesized that seedlings would allocate resources to the system (shoots or roots) affected by the most limiting treatment (simulated browsing or reduced water availability). Additionally, we evaluated whether the combination of treatments would have an additive or non-additive effect on the growth, survival and chemical composition of the seedlings. Quercus rubra seedlings reacted only to the water reduction treatment (changes in biomass and N concentration, dependent on geographic provenance) while Pinus strobus reacted only to the simulated browsing treatment (biomass and chemical composition). We also observed non-additive effects of reduced water availability and simulated browsing on Prunus serotina, Acer saccharum and Thuja occidentalis. In general, shoot:root ratio and investment in chemical defense did not vary in response to treatments. The regrowth response observed in Q. rubra and A. saccharum suggests that these species could tolerate periodic browsing events, even when water availability is reduced. More information is required to understand their long-term tolerance to repeated browsing events and to harsher and more frequent water stress. We highlight the importance of species-specific growth and allocation responses that vary with geographic provenance, which should be considered by managers when planning climate-adapted strategies, such as assisted migration.},

   abstract = {Changes in temperature and rainfall linked to recent climate change increase the mortality rates of European temperate tree species. The economic importance of trees and the ecosystem services they provide differ according to their social status (dominant or suppressed trees) and their size. The extent to which climate change impacts these different categories in different ways remains little explored. Ecophysiological differences between tree size and status suggest different sensitivities to climate change. Dominant trees are exposed to more evapotranspiration than suppressed trees that benefit from buffered climatic conditions. Large trees are able to develop a network of fine roots that allow deeper water and nutrient uptake during water shortage periods, but that have higher water requirements and more physical constraints than small trees due to the fact that they must lift water to greater heights. We used 207,100 trees from the French forest inventory data (including 3,514 dead trees), representing eight common European tree species. For each species, we separated the tree population into three subsets of suppressed, small dominant and large dominant trees. For each subset, we modelled the mortality observed in a stand in the absence of disturbances (background mortality), with a focus on the differences in sensitivity to recent changes in temperature and rainfall. After having taken the main mortality drivers related to competition into account, as well as stand characteristics including logging intensity effect, we assessed the over-mortality linked to the recent changes in temperature and rainfall for each of the three subsets. When considering both changes in temperature and rainfall, the climate change related to over-mortality was greater for suppressed than for small or large dominant trees, for all the species. Over-mortality of suppressed trees was related to temperature increase, whereas a maximum vulnerability related to rainfall decrease was observed for large dominant trees. Over-mortality driven by climate change not only concerns large and dominant trees, but small and especially suppressed ones as well. These results suggest that in addition to wood production, forest renewal and ecosystem services associated with understorey vegetation are threatened by the recent changes in temperature and rainfall in European temperate forests.},

   abstract = {The competition environments of trees in pristine forests and managed single-cohort systems differ substantially. Unconventional forest management or conservation planning for Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) forests is currently impaired due to a lack of quantitative data on what factors drive its mortality. We collected data from 57 unmanaged Norway spruce stands in Finland to estimate factors influencing the competition-induced mortality of spruce. We investigated how a simple competition index (CI) should be formulated in order to predict spruce mortality in these forests. According to our measurements and the competition index, competition among spruce was clearly one-sided, meaning that smaller trees did not affect the mortality probabilities of larger trees. In the best performing CI, which was based on competitor dbh, competitors were approximately 4 cm larger in dbh than the subject trees before they began to affect subject tree mortality. A nearly size-invariant threshold suggests that smaller spruces tolerate their larger competitors relatively better, when competitor effect is proportional to their dbh. In contrast, the CI based on competitor basal areas (∝dbh2) predicted tree mortality poorly, and the threshold was size-dependent. Our study suggests that a simple competition index based on a constant dbh-threshold and a sum of the square roots of competitors' dbh is used to predict spruce mortality in unmanaged spruce forests. This index seems to capture both the competition asymmetry and the slow mortality of suppressed trees frequently observed in forests. A simple competition index for predicting spruce mortality in unmanaged forests can easily be integrated to many forest growth models to support modeling of mortality and conservation value of Norway spruce stands. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Tree mortality is a key process shaping forest dynamics. Thus, there is a growing need for indicators of the likelihood of tree death. During the last decades, an increasing number of tree-ring based studies have aimed to derive growth-mortality functions, mostly using logistic models. The results of these studies, however, are difficult to compare and synthesize due to the diversity of approaches used for the sampling strategy (number and characteristics of alive and death observations), the type of explanatory growth variables included (level, trend, etc.), and the length of the time window (number of years preceding the alive/death observation) that maximized the discrimination ability of each growth variable. We assess the implications of key methodological decisions when developing tree-ring based growth-mortality relationships using logistic mixed-effects regression models. As examples, we use published tree-ring datasets from Abies alba (13 different sites), Nothofagus dombeyi (one site), and Quercus petraea (one site). Our approach is based on a constant sampling size and aims at (1) assessing the dependency of growth-mortality relationships on the statistical sampling scheme used, (2) determining the type of explanatory growth variables that should be considered, and (3) identifying the best length of the time window used to calculate them. The performance of tree-ring-based mortality models was reasonably high for all three species (area under the receiving operator characteristics curve, AUC > 0.7). Growth level variables were the most important predictors of mortality probability for two species (A. alba, N. dombeyi), while growth-trend variables need to be considered for Q. petraea. In addition, the length of the time window used to calculate each growth variable was highly uncertain and depended on the sampling scheme, as some growth-mortality relationships varied with tree age. The present study accounts for the main sampling-related biases to determine reliable species-specific growth-mortality relationships.

   abstract = {Tree mortality is a key factor influencing forest functions and dynamics, but our understanding of the mechanisms leading to mortality and the associated changes in tree growth rates are still limited. We compiled a new pan-continental tree-ring width database from sites where both dead and living trees were sampled (2970 dead and 4224 living trees from 190 sites, including 36 species), and compared early and recent growth rates between trees that died and those that survived a given mortality event. We observed a decrease in radial growth before death in ca. 84% of the mortality events. The extent and duration of these reductions were highly variable (1–100 years in 96% of events) due to the complex interactions among study species and the source(s) of mortality. Strong and long-lasting declines were found for gymnosperms, shade- and drought-tolerant species, and trees that died from competition. Angiosperms and trees that died due to biotic attacks (especially bark-beetles) typically showed relatively small and short-term growth reductions. Our analysis did not highlight any universal trade-off between early growth and tree longevity within a species, although this result may also reflect high variability in sampling design among sites. The intersite and interspecific variability in growth patterns before mortality provides valuable information on the nature of the mortality process, which is consistent with our understanding of the physiological mechanisms leading to mortality. Abrupt changes in growth immediately before death can be associated with generalized hydraulic failure and/or bark-beetle attack, while long-term decrease in growth may be associated with a gradual decline in hydraulic performance coupled with depletion in carbon reserves. Our results imply that growth-based mortality algorithms may be a powerful tool for predicting gymnosperm mortality induced by chronic stress, but not necessarily so for angiosperms and in case of intense drought or bark-beetle outbreaks.},

   abstract = {Aim: Forest ecosystems around the globe are facing increasing natural and human disturbances. Increasing disturbances can challenge forest resilience, that is, the capacity of forests to sustain their functions and services in the face of disturbance. Quantifying resilience across large spatial extents remains challenging, as it requires the assessment of the ability of forests to recover from disturbance. Here we analysed the resilience of Europe’s forests by means of satellite-based recovery and disturbance indicators. Location: Continental Europe (35 countries). Time period: 1986–2018. Major taxa studied: Gymnosperm and angiosperm woody plant species. Methods: We used a comprehensive set of manually interpreted reference plots and random forest regression to model annual canopy cover from remote sensing data across more than 30 million disturbance patches in Europe over the time period 1986–2018. From annual time series of canopy cover, we estimated the time it takes disturbed areas to recover to pre-disturbance canopy cover levels using space-for-time substitution. We quantified forest resilience as the ratio between canopy disturbance and recovery intervals, with critical resilience defined as forest areas where canopy disturbances occurred faster than canopy recovery. Results: On average across Europe, forests recover to pre-disturbance canopy cover within 30 years. The resilience of Europe’s forests to disturbance is high, with recovery being > 10 times faster than disturbance on 69% of the forest area. However, 14% of Europe’s forests had low or critical resilience, with disturbances occurring as fast or faster than forest canopy can recover. Main conclusions: We conclude that Europe’s forests are widely resilient to past disturbance regimes, yet changing climate and disturbance regimes could erode resilience.},

Here we present a pan-Amazonian assessment of how and why trees die, analysing over 120,000 trees representing > 3800 species from 189 long-term RAINFOR forest plots. While tree mortality rates vary greatly Amazon-wide, on average trees are as likely to die standing as they are broken or uprooted—modes of death with different ecological consequences. Species-level growth rate is the single most important predictor of tree death in Amazonia, with faster-growing species being at higher risk. Within species, however, the slowest-growing trees are at greatest risk while the effect of tree size varies across the basin. In the driest Amazonian region species-level bioclimatic distributional patterns also predict the risk of death, suggesting that these forests are experiencing climatic conditions beyond their adaptative limits. These results provide not only a holistic pan-Amazonian picture of tree death but large-scale evidence for the overarching importance of the growth–survival trade-off in driving tropical tree mortality.},

   abstract = {Strong winds may uproot and break trees and represent a major natural disturbance for European forests. Wind disturbances have intensified over the last decades globally and are expected to further rise in view of the effects of climate change. Despite the importance of such natural disturbances, there are currently no spatially explicit databases of wind-related impact at a pan-European scale. Here, we present a new database of wind disturbances in European forests (FORWIND). FORWIND is comprised of more than 80000 spatially delineated areas in Europe that were disturbed by wind in the period 2000-2018 and describes them in a harmonized and consistent geographical vector format. The database includes all major windstorms that occurred over the observational period (e.g. Gudrun, Kyrill, Klaus, Xynthia and Vaia) and represents approximately 30% of the reported damaging wind events in Europe. Correlation analyses between the areas in FORWIND and land cover changes retrieved from the Landsat-based Global Forest Change dataset and the MODIS Global Disturbance Index corroborate the robustness of FORWIND. Spearman rank coefficients range between 0.27 and 0.48 (p value&lt;0.05). When recorded forest areas are rescaled based on their damage degree, correlation increases to 0.54. Wind-damaged growing stock volumes reported in national inventories (FORESTORM dataset) are generally higher than analogous metrics provided by FORWIND in combination with satellite-based biomass and country-scale statistics of growing stock volume. The potential of FORWIND is explored for a range of challenging topics and scientific fields, including scaling relations of wind damage, forest vulnerability modelling, remote sensing monitoring of forest disturbance, representation of uprooting and breakage of trees in large-scale land surface models, and hydrogeological risks following wind damage. Overall, FORWIND represents an essential and open-access spatial source that can be used to improve the understanding, detection and prediction of wind disturbances and the consequent impacts on forest ecosystems and the land-atmosphere system. Data sharing is encouraged in order to continuously update and improve FORWIND.

   abstract = {Models are pivotal for assessing future forest dynamics under the impacts of changing climate and management practices, incorporating representations of tree growth, mortality, and regeneration. Quantitative studies on the importance of mortality submodels are scarce. We evaluated 15 dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) regarding their sensitivity to different formulations of tree mortality under different degrees of climate change. The set of models comprised eight DVMs at the stand scale, three at the landscape scale, and four typically applied at the continental to global scale. Some incorporate empirically derived mortality models, and others are based on experimental data, whereas still others are based on theoretical reasoning. Each DVM was run with at least two alternative mortality submodels. Model behavior was evaluated against empirical time series data, and then, the models were subjected to different scenarios of climate change. Most DVMs matched empirical data quite well, irrespective of the mortality submodel that was used. However, mortality submodels that performed in a very similar manner against past data often led to sharply different trajectories of forest dynamics under future climate change. Most DVMs featured high sensitivity to the mortality submodel, with deviations of basal area and stem numbers on the order of 10–40% per century under current climate and 20–170% under climate change. The sensitivity of a given DVM to scenarios of climate change, however, was typically lower by a factor of two to three. We conclude that (1) mortality is one of the most uncertain processes when it comes to assessing forest response to climate change, and (2) more data and a better process understanding of tree mortality are needed to improve the robustness of simulated future forest dynamics. Our study highlights that comparing several alternative mortality formulations in DVMs provides valuable insights into the effects of process uncertainties on simulated future forest dynamics.},

Quantifying forest vulnerability to disturbances and understanding the underlying mechanisms is crucial to develop mitigation and adaptation strategies. However, observational evidence is largely missing at regional to continental scales. Here, we quantify the vulnerability of European forests to fires, windthrows and insect outbreaks during the period 1979–2018 by integrating machine learning with disturbance data and satellite products. We show that about 33.4 billion tonnes of forest biomass could be seriously affected by these disturbances, with higher relative losses when exposed to windthrows (40%) and fires (34%) compared to insect outbreaks (26%). The spatial pattern in vulnerability is strongly controlled by the interplay between forest characteristics and background climate. Hotspot regions for vulnerability are located at the borders of the climate envelope, in both southern and northern Europe. There is a clear trend in overall forest vulnerability that is driven by a warming-induced reduction in plant defence mechanisms to insect outbreaks, especially at high latitudes.},

   abstract = { The choice of revegetating via direct seeding or planting nursery-grown seedlings influences the potential stresses suffered by seedlings such as herbivory and drought. The outcome of the balance between both revegetation methods may ultimately depend on how species identity and traits such as seed and seedling size interact with environmental conditions. To test this, we will conduct a continental-scale experiment consisting of one mini-experiment replicated by multiple participants across Europe. Each participant will establish a site with seeded and planted individuals of one or more native, locally growing oak ( Quercus ) species; the selection of this genus aims to favour continental-scale participation and to allow testing the response of a widely distributed genus of broad ecological and economic relevance. At each site, participants will follow the present protocol for seed collection, seeding in the field, nursery cultivation, outplanting, protection against herbivores, site maintenance, and measurement of seedling performance and environmental variables. Each measurement on each species at each site will produce one effect size; the data will be analysed through mixed-effects meta-analysis. With this approach we will assess the main effect of revegetation method, species, plant functional traits, and the potential effect of site-specific effect moderators. Overall, we will provide a continental-scale estimate on the seeding vs . planting dilemma and analyse to what extent the differences in environmental conditions across sites, seed size, functional traits, and the phylogenetic relatedness of species can account for the differences in the effect of revegetation method on seedling performance across study sites and species. },

For the commercially significant spruce and fir forests of the province, we found growing degree-days (GDD) to negatively correlate with tree productivity in warmer regions, such as much of Newfoundland (61350 GDD), but positively correlate with growth in cooler regions, such as those in Labrador (6750 GDD). With respect to precipitation, environmental moisture was not on average a limiting factor to species productivity in the province.

Results suggest a very strong relationship between annual mean temperature and degree-days. Incorporating standard deviation (SD) of monthly mean temperature and latitude increases the accuracy of prediction (R 2 >.99), demonstrating the strength of the location-agnostic relationship in predicting degree-days from two temperature parameters: annual mean and SD of monthly mean. Research findings can be used to calculate degree-days of locations, for which daily temperature data may not be available. The equation can also be used to calculate degree-days from low-resolution global circulation model (GCM) projections of increasing temperature, for investigating the impact of climate change on building heating and cooling energy demand at global scale without the need to create synthetic weather series through morphing or downscaling. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {High-resolution information on climatic conditions is essential to many applications in environmental and ecological sciences. The CHELSA (Climatologies at high resolution for the earth’s land surface areas) data (Karger et al. 2017) consists of downscaled model output temperature and precipitation estimates at a horizontal resolution of 30 arc sec. The temperature algorithm is mainly based on statistical downscaling of atmospheric temperatures. The precipitation algorithm incorporates orographic predictors including wind fields, valley exposition, and boundary layer height, with a subsequent bias correction. The resulting data consist of a monthly temperature and precipitation data and various derived parameters. As the CHELSA project is continuously expanded, certain new parameters, time scales etc. are not included anymore in the original publication (Karger et al. 2017). We are therefore provide this document as a guideline of the current climatic parameters available and will expand it as new parameters or time periods will become available. Please refer to the version history for changes made in the document. Some of the parameter descriptions are different from those of the original publication (Karger et al. 2017), as we tried to keep as much of them consistent with CF naming conventions. Not all parameters however have a respective CF name.},

   abstract = {Challenges exist for assessing the impacts of climate and climate change on the hydrological cycle on local and regional scales, and in turn on water resources, food, energy, and natural hazards. Potential evapotranspiration (PET) represents atmospheric demand for water, which is required at high spatial and temporal resolutions to compute actual evapotranspiration and thus close the water balance near the land surface for many such applications, but there are currently no available high-resolution datasets of PET. Here we develop an hourly PET dataset (hPET) for the global land surface at 0.1° spatial resolution, based on output from the recently developed ERA5-Land reanalysis dataset, over the period 1981 to present. We show how hPET compares to other available global PET datasets, over common spatiotemporal resolutions and time frames, with respect to spatial patterns of climatology and seasonal variations for selected humid and arid locations across the globe. We provide the data for users to employ for multiple applications to explore diurnal and seasonal variations in evaporative demand for water.},

   abstract = {Background European forests have a long record of management. However, the diversity of the current forest management across nations, tree species and owners, is hardly understood. Often when trying to simulate future forest resources under alternative futures, simply the yield table style of harvesting is applied. It is now crucially important to come to grips with actual forest management, now that demand for wood is increasing and the EU Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry Regulation has been adopted requiring ‘continuation of current management practices’ as a baseline to set the Forest Reference Level carbon sink. Methods Based on a large dataset of 714,000 re-measured trees in National Forest inventories from 13 regions, we are now able to analyse actual forest harvesting. Conclusions From this large set of repeated tree measurements we can conclude that there is no such thing as yield table harvesting in Europe. We found general trends of increasing harvest probability with higher productivity of the region and the species, but with important deviations related to local conditions like site accessibility, state of the forest resource (like age), specific subsidies, importance of other forest services, and ownership of the forest. As a result, we find a huge diversity in harvest regimes. Over the time period covered in our inventories, the average harvest probability over all regions was 2.4% yr-1 (in number of trees) and the mortality probability was 0.4% yr-1. Our study provides underlying and most actual data that can serve as a basis for quantifying ‘continuation of current forest management’. It can be used as a cornerstone for the base period as required for the Forest Reference Level for EU Member States.},

   abstract = {Tree harvest and climate change can interact to have synergistic effects on tree species distribution changes. However, few studies have investigated the interactive effects of tree harvest and climate change on tree species distributions. We assessed the interactive effects of tree harvest and climate change on the distribution of 29 dominant tree species at 270 m resolution in the southern United States, while accounting for species demography, competition, urban growth and natural fire. We simulated tree species distribution changes to year 2100 using a coupled forest dynamic model (LANDIS PRO), ecosystem process model (LINKAGES) and urban growth model (SLEUTH). The distributions of 20 tree species contracted and nine species expanded within the region under climate change by end of 21st century. Distribution changes for all tree species were very slow and lagged behind the changes in potential distributions that were in equilibrium with new climatic conditions. Tree harvest and climate change interacted to affect species occurrences and colonization but not extinction. Occurrence and colonization were mainly affected by tree harvest and its interaction with climate change while extinctions were mainly affected by tree harvest and climate change. Synthesis and applications. Interactive effects of climate and tree harvest acted in the same direction as climate change effects on species occurrences, thereby accelerating climate change induced contraction or expansion of distributions. The overall interactive effects on species colonization were negative, specifically with positive interactive effects at leading edges of species ranges and negative interactive effects at trailing edges. Tree harvest generally did not interact with climate change to greatly facilitate or ameliorate species extinction. Our modelling results highlight the importance of considering disturbances and species demography (e.g. post-harvest regeneration dynamics) when predicting changes in tree distributions.},

   abstract = {Aim: Large disturbances increasingly shape the world's forests. Concomitantly, increasing amounts of forest are subject to salvage logging. Understanding and managing the world's forests thus increasingly hinges upon understanding the combined effects of natural disturbance and logging disturbance, including interactions so far unnoticed. Here, we use recent advances in disturbance-interaction theory to disentangle and describe the mechanisms through which natural disturbance (e.g., wildfire, insect outbreak or windstorm) can interact with anthropogenic disturbance (logging) to produce unanticipated effects. We also explore to what extent such interactions have been addressed in empirical research globally. Insights: First, many ecological responses to salvage logging likely result from interaction modifications—i.e., from non-additive effects– between natural disturbance and logging. However, based on a systematic review encompassing 209 relevant papers, we found that interaction modifications have been largely neglected. Second, salvage logging constitutes an interaction chain because natural disturbances increase the likelihood, intensity and extent of subsequent logging disturbance due to complex socio-ecological interactions. Both interaction modifications and interaction chains can be driven by nonlinear responses to the severity of each disturbance. We show that, whereas many of the effects of salvage logging likely arise from the multiple kinds of disturbance interactions between natural disturbance and logging, they have mostly been overlooked in research to date. Conclusions: Interactions between natural disturbance and logging imply that increasing disturbances will produce even more disturbance, and with unknown characteristics and consequences. Disentangling the pathways producing disturbance interactions is thus crucial to guide management and policy regarding naturally disturbed forests.},

   abstract = {As population-level patterns of interest in forests emerge from individual vital rates, modelling forest dynamics requires making the link between the scales at which data are collected (individual stems) and the scales at which questions are asked (e.g. populations and communities). Structured population models (e.g. integral projection models (IPMs)) are useful tools for linking vital rates to population dynamics. However, the application of such models to forest trees remains challenging owing to features of tree life cycles, such as slow growth, long lifespan and lack of data on crucial ontogenic stages.We developed a survival model that accounts for size-dependent mortality and a growth model that characterizes individual heterogeneity. We integrated vital rate models into two types of population model; an analytically tractable form of IPM and an individual-based model (IBM) that is applied with stochastic simulations. We calculated longevities, passage times to, and occupancy time in, different life cycle stages, important metrics for understanding how demographic rates translate into patterns of forest turnover and carbon residence times. Here, we illustrate the methods for three tropical forest species with varying life-forms. Population dynamics from IPMs and IBMs matched a 34 year time series of data (albeit a snapshot of the life cycle for canopy trees) and highlight differences in life-history strategies between species. Specifically, the greater variation in growth rates within the two canopy species suggests an ability to respond to available resources, which in turn manifests as faster passage times and greater occupancy times in larger size classes. The framework presented here offers a novel and accessible approach to modelling the population dynamics of forest trees.},

   abstract = {An understanding of the drivers of tree growth at the species level is required to predict likely changes of carbon stocks and biodiversity when environmental conditions change. Especially in species-rich tropical forests, it is largely unknown how species differ in their response of growth to resource availability and individual size. We use a hierarchical Bayesian approach to quantify the impact of light availability and tree diameter on growth of 274 woody species in a 50-ha long-term forest census plot in Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Light reaching each individual tree was estimated from yearly vertical censuses of canopy density. The hierarchical Bayesian approach allowed accounting for different sources of error, such as negative growth observations, and including rare species correctly weighted by their abundance. All species grew faster at higher light. Exponents of a power function relating growth to light were mostly between 0 and 1. This indicates that nearly all species exhibit a decelerating increase of growth with light. In contrast, estimated growth rates at standardized conditions (5 cm dbh, 5% light) varied over a 9-fold range and reflect strong growth-strategy differentiation between the species. As a consequence, growth rankings of the species at low (2%) and high light (20%) were highly correlated. Rare species tended to grow faster and showed a greater sensitivity to light than abundant species. Overall, tree size was less important for growth than light and about half the species were predicted to grow faster in diameter when bigger or smaller, respectively. Together light availability and tree diameter only explained on average 12% of the variation in growth rates. Thus, other factors such as soil characteristics, herbivory, or pathogens may contribute considerably to shaping tree growth in the tropics.},

   abstract = {Integral projection models (IPMs) are an important tool for studying the dynamics of populations structured by one or more continuous traits (e.g. size, height, body mass). Researchers use IPMs to investigate questions ranging from linking drivers to population dynamics, planning conservation and management strategies, and quantifying selective pressures in natural populations. The popularity of stage-structured population models has been supported by R scripts and packages (e.g. IPMpack, popbio, popdemo, lefko3) aimed at ecologists, which have introduced a broad repertoire of functionality and outputs. However, pressing ecological, evolutionary and conservation biology topics require developing more complex IPMs, and considerably more expertise to implement them. Here, we introduce ipmr, a flexible R package for building, analysing and interpreting IPMs. The ipmr framework relies on the mathematical notation of the models to express them in code format. Additionally, this package decouples the model parameterization step from the model implementation step. The latter point substantially increases ipmr's flexibility to model complex life cycles and demographic processes. ipmr can handle a wide variety of models, including those that incorporate density dependence, discretely and continuously varying stochastic environments, and multiple continuous and/or discrete traits. ipmr can accommodate models with individuals cross-classified by age and size. Furthermore, the package provides methods for demographic analyses (e.g. asymptotic and stochastic growth rates) and visualization (e.g. kernel plotting). ipmr is a flexible R package for integral projection models. The package substantially reduces the amount of time required to implement general IPMs. We also provide extensive documentation with six vignettes and help files, accessible from an R session and online.},

   abstract = {Tree mortality is caused by complex interactions between multiple biotic and abiotic factors. Processes of tree mortality that are not induced by natural disturbances are often reflected in distinct radial growth patterns of trees, which typically serve as reliable indicators of impending tree mortality. However, it remains unclear whether empirical mortality models that are based on tree size and growth result in more realistic projections of forest succession in dynamic vegetation models (DVMs). We used a combination of tree-ring and inventory data from unmanaged Swiss natural forest reserves to derive species-specific survival models for six Central European tree species (Abies alba, Fagus sylvatica, Larix decidua, Picea abies, Pinus cembra and Quercus spp.). We jointly used 528 tree-ring samples and inventory data from eight forest reserves. We implemented the estimated parameters of the survival models into the DVM ForClim and performed simulations of forest succession that were validated using the inventory data of the forest reserves. Size- and growth-dependent variables (i.e., diameter at breast height and mean ring width) over the last few years prior to tree death were reliable predictors to distinguish between dying and living trees. Very low mean ring widths over several preceding years as well as small and large trees, respectively, reflected low survival probabilities. However, the small sample sizes of small and large trees resulted in considerable uncertainty of the survival probabilities. The implementation of these survival models in ForClim yielded plausible projections in short-term simulations and for some sites improved the predictions compared to the current ForClim version. Stand basal area, however, tended to be overestimated. Long-term simulations of ForClim based on the empirical survival models resulted in realistic predictions only if the uncertainty of the predicted survival probabilities was considered. We conclude that the combination of different data sources in combination with the consideration of intra-specific trait variability yields robust predictions of tree survival probabilities, thus paving the way towards better tree mortality models and more reliable projections of future forest dynamics.},

Tree mortality associated with acute disturbance events, in contrast, is conspicuous and frequently studied, but there remains a lack of research regarding the role of background mortality processes in mediating the severity and delayed effects of disturbance. We conducted an empirical study by measuring the rates, causes, and spatial pattern of mortality annually among 32,989 individual trees within a large forest demography plot in the Sierra Nevada. We characterized the relationships between background mortality, compound disturbances (fire and drought), and forest spatial structure, and we integrated our findings with a synthesis of the existing literature from around the world to develop a conceptual framework describing the spatio-temporal signatures of background and disturbance-related tree mortality. The interactive effects of fire, drought, and background mortality processes altered the rate, spatial structuring, and ecological consequences of mortality. Before fire, spatially non-random mortality was only evident among small (1 < cm DBH ≤ 10)- and medium (10 < cm DBH ≤ 60)-diameter classes; mortality rates were low (1.7% per yr), and mortality was density-dependent among small-diameter trees. Direct fire damage caused the greatest number of moralities (70% of stems ≥1 cm DBH), but the more enduring effects of this disturbance on the demography and spatial pattern of large-diameter trees occurred during the post-fire mortality regime. The combined effects of disturbance and biotic mortality agents provoked density-dependent mortality among large-diameter (≥60 cm DBH) trees, eliciting a distinct post-disturbance mortality regime that did not resemble the pattern of either pre-fire mortality or direct fire effects. The disproportionate ecological significance of the largest trees renders this mortality regime acutely consequential to the long-term structure and function of forests.},

   abstract = {Tree mortality is an important demographic process and primary driver of forest dynamics, yet there are relatively few plot-based studies that explicitly quantify mortality and compare the relative contribution of endogenous and exogenous disturbances at regional scales. We used repeated observations on 289,390 trees in 3673 1 ha plots on U.S. Forest Service lands in Oregon and Washington to compare distributions of mortality rates among natural disturbances and vegetation zones from the mid-1990s to mid-2000s, a period characterized by drought, insect outbreaks, and large wildfires. Endogenous disturbances (e.g. pathogens, insects) were pervasive but operated at relatively low levels of mortality (<2.5%/yr) that rarely exceeded 5%/yr. Exogenous disturbances (e.g. fire, wind, landslides, avalanches) were less common and operated mostly at intermediate levels of mortality (5-25%/yr) indicative of partial-stand-replacement events. Stand-replacing mortality rates (≥25%/yr) comprised a third of all exogenous disturbance events, occurring almost exclusively in fires. Fires were rare in wet vegetation zones and most rates were <2.5%/yr and associated with endogenous processes. Mortality rates in dry vegetation zones revealed a different set of dynamics including a more variable role of background mortality and greater proportions of mortality associated with fire and insects at partial- and stand-replacing levels. Mortality rates in early and middle stages of stand development were low compared to published rates, but rates >1%/yr in over half of the plots in late and old-growth stages corroborate previous findings of elevated mortality during the same period and indicate the potential for pervasive structural change across all vegetation zones. Partial- and stand-replacing fire were associated with most mortality, but affected a relatively small proportion of dry vegetation zones (3.1-7.1% and 2.1-5.1%, respectively). These disturbances have likely affected regional biodiversity through the creation of early seral habitat, increased within-stand heterogeneity, and restored some aspects of historical fire regimes, but there is a need to better understand corresponding structural and compositional changes. We demonstrate the variability in the drivers, magnitude, and extent of mortality across a biophysically diverse region and highlight the need to incorporate and characterize the effects of mortality at intermediate levels to develop a more comprehensive understanding of regional forest dynamics.},

Because LTS algorithms can be easily applied across broad areas, they are commonly used to map changes in forest structure due to wildfire, insect attack, and other important drivers of tree mortality. But factors such as initial forest density, tree mortality agent, and disturbance severity (i.e., percent tree mortality) influence patterns of surface reflectance and may influence the accuracy of LTS algorithms. And while LTS algorithms are widely used in areas with a history of multiple disturbance events during the Landsat record, the effectiveness of LTS algorithms in these conditions is not well understood. We compared products from the LTS algorithm LandTrendr (Landsat-based Detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery) with a unique field dataset from a landscape heavily influenced by both wildfire and spruce beetles (Dendroctonus rufipennis) since c. 2000. We also compared LandTrendr to other common methods of mapping fire- and spruce beetle-affected areas. We found that LandTrendr more accurately detected wildfire than spruce beetle-induced tree mortality, and both mortality agents were more easily detected when they occurred at high severity. Surprisingly, prior spruce beetle outbreaks did not influence the detectability of subsequent wildfire. Compared to alternative disturbance mapping approaches, LandTrendr predicted a c. 40% lower area affected by wildfire or spruce beetle outbreaks. Our findings indicate that disturbance type- and severity-specific differences in omission error may have broad implications for disturbance mapping efforts that utilize Landsat data. Gradual, low-severity disturbances (e.g., background tree mortality and non-stand replacing disturbance) are pervasive in forest ecosystems, yet they can be difficult to detect using automated LTS algorithms. Whenever possible, methods to account for these biases should be incorporated in LTS-based mapping efforts, including the use of multispectral ensembles and ancillary spatial data to refine predictions. However, our findings also indicate that LTS algorithms appear to be robust in areas with multiple disturbance events, which is important because these areas will increase as new acquisitions extend the length of the Landsat record.},

The underlying mechanisms of fire-caused tree mortality remain poorly understood, however, limiting the ability to accurately predict mortality and develop robust modeling applications, especially under novel future climates. Virtually all post-fire tree mortality prediction systems are based on the same underlying empirical model described in Ryan and Reinhardt (1988 Can. J. For. Res. 18 1291-7), which was developed from a limited number of species, stretching model assumptions beyond intended limits. We review the current understanding of the mechanisms of fire-induced tree mortality, provide recommended standardized terminology, describe model applications and limitations, and conclude with key knowledge gaps and future directions for research. We suggest a two-pronged approach to future research: (1) continued improvements and evaluations of empirical models to quantify uncertainty and incorporate new regions and species and (2) acceleration of basic, physiological research on the proximate and ultimate causes of fire-induced tree mortality to incorporate processes of tree death into models. Advances in both empirical and process fire-induced tree modeling will allow creation of hybrid models that could advance understanding of how fire injures and kills trees, while improving prediction accuracy of fire-driven feedbacks on ecosystems and landscapes, particularly under novel future conditions.},

The extensive forests across the southern Amazonia edge—the driest, warmest and most fragmented of the Amazon regions—provide a window onto what the future of large parts of Amazonia may look like. Understanding tree mortality and its drivers here is essential to anticipate the process across other parts of the basin. Using 10 years of data from a widespread network of long-term forest plots, we assessed how trees die (standing, broken or uprooted) and used generalised mixed-effect models to explore the contribution of plot-, species- and tree-level factors to the likelihood of tree death. Most trees died from stem breakage (54%); a smaller proportion died standing (41%), while very few were uprooted (5%). The mortality rate for standing dead trees was greatest in forests subject to the most intense dry seasons. While trees with the crown more exposed to light were more prone to death from mechanical damage, trees less exposed were more susceptible to death from drought. At the species level, mortality rates were lowest for those species with the greatest wood density. At the individual tree level, physical damage to the crown via branch breakage was the strongest predictor of tree death. Synthesis. Wind- and water deficit-driven disturbances are the main causes of tree death in southern Amazonia edge which is concerning considering the predicted increase in seasonality for Amazonia, especially at the edge. Tree mortality here is greater than any in other Amazonian region, thus any increase in mortality here may represent a tipping point for these forests.},

   abstract = {With the rise of large herbivore populations in most northern hemisphere forests, browsing is becoming an increasingly important driver of forest regeneration dynamics. Among other processes affecting the regeneration, the concept of plant-herbivore feedback loops holds that browsed saplings are more subject to subsequent herbivory. This phenomenon is interpreted as a consequence of compensatory growth following browsing since fast growth is generally associated with higher digestibility and lower defense against herbivores. However, studies linking browsing-induced trait variations to subsequent attractiveness to herbivores are still lacking, especially in the forest context. In this study, we experimentally examine the existence of a feedback loop between oak (Quercus robur L.) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and investigate its underlying morphological and chemical traits. We simulated single and repeated roe deer browsing on nursery-grown oak saplings and measured the changes in sapling height growth, lateral branching, leaf traits and winter shoot traits over two years. We conducted winter feeding trials with tame roe deer one year after the first treatment to test the effect of simulated browsing on sapling attractiveness. Simulated browsing reduced sapling height growth but had no effect on branching. Simulated browsing had no effect on leaf traits after half a year, but decreased the phenolic content and increased the fiber content of winter shoots the following winter. Contrary to our predictions, roe deer preferentially browsed control saplings over saplings previously browsed. After two years, repeated browsing promoted fast carbon acquisition leaf traits (high chlorophyll, high specific leaf area and low fiber content), reduced leaf phenolic content and increased leaf digestibility. We showed that a reduction in 1-year-old oak sapling height growth following browsing, combined with increased structural defense at the expense of chemical defense in winter shoots the following winter, was correlated with reduced browsing pressure, thereby challenging the feedback loop hypothesis. However, we also demonstrated that repeated browsing promoted fast carbon acquisition leaf traits in 2.5-year-old saplings, which tend to support the existence of a feedback loop on older and more intensively browsed saplings. As such, our study provides empirical evidence that morphological and physiological trait responses to browsing influence oak sapling attractiveness, but that the direction and magnitude of this effect depend on the ontogenic stage of the sapling and on the number of browsing events.},

   abstract = {<p> There are several mechanisms that allow plants to temporarily escape from top-down control. One of them is trophic cascades triggered by top predators or pathogens. Another is satiation of consumers by mast seeding. These two mechanisms have traditionally been studied in separation. However, their combined action may have a greater effect on plant release than either process alone. In 2015, an outbreak of a disease (African swine fever, ASF) caused a crash in wild boar ( <italic>Sus scrofa</italic> ) abundance in Białowieża Primeval Forest. Wild boar are important consumers of acorns and are difficult to satiate relative to less mobile granivores. We hypothesized that the joint action of the ASF outbreak and masting would enhance regeneration of oaks ( <italic>Quercus robur</italic> ). Data from ungulate exclosures demonstrated that ASF led to reduction in acorn predation. Tree seedling data indicated that oak recruitment increased twofold relative to pre-epidemic period. Our results showed that perturbations caused by wildlife disease travel through food webs and influence forest dynamics. The outbreak of ASF acted synergistically with masting and removed herbivore top-down control of oaks by mobile consumers. This illustrates that the ASF epidemic that currently occurs across Europe can have broad effects on forest dynamics. </p>},

   abstract = {Phenotypic traits and their associated trade-offs have been shown to have globally consistent effects on individual plant physiological functions, but how these effects scale up to influence competition, a key driver of community assembly in terrestrial vegetation, has remained unclear. Here we use growth data from more than 3 million trees in over 140,000 plots across the world to show how three key functional traits - wood density, specific leaf area and maximum height - consistently influence competitive interactions. Fast maximum growth of a species was correlated negatively with its wood density in all biomes, and positively with its specific leaf area in most biomes. Low wood density was also correlated with a low ability to tolerate competition and a low competitive effect on neighbours, while high specific leaf area was correlated with a low competitive effect. Thus, traits generate trade-offs between performance with competition versus performance without competition, a fundamental ingredient in the classical hypothesis that the coexistence of plant species is enabled via differentiation in their successional strategies. Competition within species was stronger than between species, but an increase in trait dissimilarity between species had little influence in weakening competition. No benefit of dissimilarity was detected for specific leaf area or wood density, and only a weak benefit for maximum height. Our trait-based approach to modelling competition makes generalization possible across the forest ecosystems of the world and their highly diverse species composition.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Summary 1. Herbivore damage can select for tolerance in plant populations where genetic variation for tolerance exists. The causes underlying variation in tolerance are not fully resolved. We assessed the importance of two potential mechanisms for tolerance by examining its relationship with leaf photosynthetic rate and relative biomass allocation across plant organs. 2. We monitored responses of 12 aspen (Populus tremuloides) genotypes, grown in a common garden under two levels of nutrient availability, to defoliation in two successive seasons. Tolerance of each genotype was calculated as the difference in growth between defoliated and undefoliated trees grown under the same nutrient conditions. 3. Although light-saturated leaf photosynthesis increased in response to nutrient addition and defoliation, it did not vary among genotypes and was not correlated with tolerance. 4. Tolerance was, however, correlated with patterns of biomass allocation. Under low-nutrient conditions it was positively correlated with the proportion of biomass in stems just prior to defoliation, while under high-nutrient conditions it was correlated with greater allocation to stems in response to damage. 5. Herbivores may select for specific patterns of biomass allocation in trees, and do so differently in different environments. The positive correlation between tolerance and relative allocation to stems, as opposed to roots, runs counter to reports from studies of herbaceous species and underscores the need for further exploration of mechanisms of tolerance in woody plants.},

   abstract = {Water availability is the main determinant of species' distribution in lowland tropical forests. Species' occurrence along water availability gradients depends on their ability to tolerate drought. 2. To identify species' traits underlying drought-tolerance we excavated first year seedlings of 62 dry and moist forest tree species at the onset of the dry season. We evaluate how morphological seedling traits differ between forests, and whether functional groups of species can be identified based on trait relations. We also compare seedling traits along independent axes of drought and shade-tolerance to assess a hypothesized trade-off. 3. Seedlings of dry forest species improve water foraging capacity in deep soil layers by an increased below-ground biomass allocation and by having deep roots. They minimize the risk of cavitation by making dense stems, and reduce transpiration by producing less leaf tissue. Moist forest seedlings have large leaf areas and a greater above-ground biomass, to maximize light interception, and long, cheap, branched root systems, to increase water and nutrient capture. 4. Associations among seedling traits reveal three major drought strategies: (i) evergreen drought-tolerant species have high biomass investment in enduring organs, minimize cavitation and minimize transpiration to persist under dry conditions; (ii) drought-avoiding species maximize resource capture during a limited growing season and then avoid stress with a deciduous leaf habit in the dry season; (iii) drought-intolerant species maximize both below- and above-ground resource capture to increase competitiveness for light, but are consequently precluded from dry habitats. 5. We found no direct trade-off between drought- and shade-tolerance, because they depend largely on different morphological adaptations. Drought-tolerance is supported by a high biomass investment to the root system, whereas shade-tolerance is mainly promoted by a low growth rate and low SLA. 6. Synthesis. We conclude that there are three general adaptation strategies of drought-tolerance, which seemingly hold true across biomes and for different life forms. Drought- and shade-tolerance are largely independent from one another, suggesting a high potential for niche differentiation, as species' specialization can occur at different combinations of water and light availability. © 2009 British Ecological Society.},

   abstract = {Questions: How have tree growth and growth trends varied in structurally complex old-growth forests? What determines this variation and how this differs among species? Location: Natural boreal old-growth forests, northern Finland. Methods: We sampled trees over 10-cm diameter on 48 randomly located 0.1-ha plots in three landscapes and compiled a data set of 1,565 trees including all three main species, and a full range of sizes and competitive states in northern boreal old-growth forests. We extracted tree ring samples from every tree and used ring widths to reconstruct tree sizes and their neighbourhood for the past 50 years for Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies, and 30 years for Betula pubescens. We used mixed-effects models to study variation in tree growth. In the models, we used annually varying environmental variables, forest and tree structural variables and site variables as predictors. We also measured soil hydraulic properties for a water balance model to specifically include soil moisture deficits as predictors. Results: Tree growth rates had increased during the analysis period for all three species, with the highest increases for P. sylvestris and B. pubescens. All three species grew well during warm summers, but P. sylvestris and P. abies growth was also negatively influenced by soil moisture deficits. Competition in these sparse forests had a small influence on growth. However, its influence increased over time. Conclusions: The trees showed positive growth trends, but the increasing competition means that such strong positive trends are unlikely to continue over the long term. For year-to-year variability, negative influence of droughts implied that increasing temperatures are not only beneficial to tree growth even in these high-latitude forests. Overall, the findings demonstrate the site-and species-dependent complexity in tree responses to environmental and structural changes we may expect in the future.},

   abstract = {We investigated the effect of light availability and soil moisture on growth and biomass partitioning of Norway spruce and European beech seedlings in a three (light availability levels) × two (soil moisture levels) factorial greenhouse experiment. The effects of factor levels on allocation to biomass compartments were analyzed using ANCOVA. As plant allocation patterns are size-dependent, tree size was used as a covariate. In both tree species, growth and biomass allocation to above and belowground plant components were affected by light availability. European beech showed a distinct increase in allocation to leaves, stem and branch biomass at the expense of fine and coarse roots with decreasing light availability. For Norway spruce, only allocation to stem biomass increased and allocation to fine root biomass decreased under low light. To drought a significant increase of the percentage of belowground compartments was found for European beech but not for Norway spruce. Overall, European beech seedlings were more plastic than Norway spruce seedlings. European beech seedlings appear better able to adjust biomass partitioning to resource availability. In contrast Norway spruce responded languidly. Our results indicate that biomass partitioning is not only driven by ontogeny, and thus tree size, but is environmentally determined to a substantial degree. A possible explanation for this divergence from other results on the role of ontogeny in biomass partitioning may be that seedling plasticity in response to limited resources declines with increasing age and/or time of exposure to the limited resources. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {In tropical forests, insect herbivores exert significant pressure on plant populations. Adaptation to such pressure is hypothesized to be a driver of high tropical diversity, but direct evidence for local adaptation to herbivory in tropical forests is sparse. At the same time, herbivore pressure has been hypothesized to increase with rainfall in the tropics, which could lead to differences among sites in the degree of local adaptation. To assess the presence of local adaptation and its interaction with rainfall, we compared herbivore damage on seedlings of local vs. nonlocal populations at sites differing in moisture availability in a reciprocal transplant experiment spanning a rainfall gradient in Panama. For 13 native tree species, seeds collected from multiple populations along the rainfall gradient were germinated in a shadehouse and then transplanted to experimental sites within the species range. We tracked the proportion of seedlings attacked over 1.5 yr and quantified the percentage of leaf area damaged at the end of the study. Seedlings originating from local populations were less likely to be attacked and experienced lower amounts of herbivore damage than those from nonlocal populations, but only on the wetter end of the rainfall gradient. However, overall herbivore damage was higher at the drier site compared to wetter sites, contrary to expectation. Taken together, these findings support the idea that herbivory can result in local adaptation within tropical tree species; however, the likelihood of local adaptation varies among sites because of environmentally driven differences in investment in defense or herbivore specialization or both.},

In many cases, these efforts ignore reductions in browse availability due to snow burial because this effect is difficult to measure. In this paper, we show how consideration of snow burial can alter the relative availability of browse in 6 forest communities common in the east slopes of the Rocky Mountains of the Alberta, Canada. We developed species-specific allometric relationships of stem diameter and woody twig biomass and height for the common shrub species and used these models to predict the decline in the proportion of total biomass/stem available to ungulates relative to stem height. Based on measures of stem densities, we then compared declines in browse availability for all browse species and for preferred browse species with increasing snow depths. Species compositional differences between forest types influenced the decline in browse availability as snow depth increased. Our stem-based approach is more flexible than previous plot-based approaches because it does not assume a distribution in stem heights but uses local information.

   abstract = {At northern latitudes, large spatial and temporal variation in the nutritional composition of available foods poses challenges to wild herbivores trying to satisfy their nutrient requirements. Studies conducted in mostly captive settings have shown that animals from a variety of taxonomic groups deal with this challenge by adjusting the amounts and proportions of available food combinations to achieve a target nutrient balance. In this study, we used proportions-based nutritional geometry to analyze the nutritional composition of rumen samples collected in winter from 481 moose (Alces alces) in southern Sweden and examine whether free-ranging moose show comparable patterns of nutrient balancing. Our main hypothesis was that wild moose actively regulate their rumen nutrient composition to offset ecologically imposed variation in the nutritional composition of available foods. To test this, we assessed the macronutritional composition (protein, carbohydrates, and lipids) of rumen contents and commonly eaten foods, including supplementary feed, across populations with contrasting winter diets, spanning an area of approximately 10,000 km2. Our results suggest that moose balanced the macronutrient composition of their rumen, with the rumen contents having consistently similar proportional relationship between protein and nonstructural carbohydrates, despite differences in available (and eaten) foods. Furthermore, we found that rumen macronutrient balance was tightly related to ingested levels of dietary fiber (cellulose and hemicellulose), such that the greater the fiber content, the less protein was present in the rumen compared with nonstructural carbohydrates. Our results also suggest that moose benefit from access to a greater variety of trees, shrubs, herbs, and grasses, which provides them with a larger nutritional space to maneuver within. Our findings provide novel theoretical insights into a model species for ungulate nutritional ecology, while also generating data of direct relevance to wildlife and forest management, such as silvicultural or supplementary feeding practices.},

   abstract = {Aim: Old-growth, mesic temperate forests are often assumed to be structured by gap-phase processes, resulting in quasi-equilibrial long-term dynamics. This assumption influences management focused on simulation of natural disturbance dynamics and is embedded in most models of forest successional dynamics. We use multi-decade monitoring of permanent plots in old-growth forests to assess demographic assumptions directly with respect to tree mortality rates. Location: Sixteen sites in mesic, temperate old-growth forests in eastern North America and Europe with multi-decade monitoring. Time period: Variable across sites, spanning c. 20–78 years from 1936 to 2014. Major taxa studied: Tree species of late-successional, cool-temperate forests of Europe and eastern North America. Methods: We calculated and compared the annualized mortality rates (m), with confidence intervals, by species, size class and measurement interval, for tree species of sufficient abundance. Results: Retrospective analysis shows dynamic and diverse demographic properties across populations and sites. Stand-scale mortality rates of 0.7–2.5%/year average higher than previous estimates for old-growth temperate forests. Variations among species, over time and among size classes, suggest that gap-phase models are inadequate to explain stand dynamics, implying instead that rare disturbance events of moderate severity have long-lasting effects in old-growth forests and that indirect anthropogenic influences affect old-growth, unlogged forests. Main conclusions: Multi-decade baseline data, essential for understanding community assembly and long-term dynamics in these “slow systems,” are rare and poorly integrated. Our analysis demonstrates the value of the few long-term, “legacy” data sets. Results suggest that differences in life history interact with complex disturbance histories, resulting in non-equilibrial dynamics in old-growth temperate tree communities, and that changes in disturbance patterns through anthropogenic climate change might, therefore, be an important driver of ecosystem change.},

However, due to their rarity and the logistical challenges of directly observing such extreme events, both the spatial variability of disturbance intensity and the species-specific responses to this variability are poorly understood. We used observed patterns of mortality across a fire severity gradient following the 2009 Black Saturday fires in southeastern Australia to simultaneously estimate (1) species- and size-specific susceptibility to fire-induced mortality and (2) fire intensity. We found broad variation in patterns of fire susceptibility among the 10 tree species (five eucalypts and five non-eucalypts) sufficiently abundant for analysis. Among the eucalypts, Eucalyptus obliqua was the most resistant to fire-induced mortality, with trees of ~25 cm DBH having a 50% probability of surviving even the most intense fires. In contrast, E. regnans had 100% mortality across all size classes when subjected to high-intensity fire. Basal resprouting occurred in six of the study species and, when accounted for, fundamentally changed the mortality profile of these species, highlighting the importance of resprouting as an adaptation to fire in these landscapes. In particular, the two iconic cool temperate rainforest species (Nothofagus cunninghami and Atherosperma moschatum) were strong resprouters (~45% of individuals were able to resprout after being top-killed by fire). We also found evidence for compositional shifts in regeneration above threshold values of fire intensity in cool temperate rainforest and mixed forest sites, both of which have important conservation values within these landscapes. The observed patterns of species- and size-specific susceptibility to fire-induced mortality may be used to anticipate changes in forest structure and composition in the future. In addition, they may also help guide forest management strategies that reduce the length of time individual trees are exposed to potentially lethal fires, thereby increasing the resilience of these forests to future fires.},

   abstract = {Conservation of biological diversity is a key criterion in all sustainable forest management certification schemes. A common strategy for maintaining stand-level diversity after forest harvesting on the coast of British Columbia is variable retention. This approach leaves diverse amounts, types and patterns of tree retention, ranging from single trees to large patches of the original forest. Variable retention contributes to diversity of stand structure; however, wind damage may have a significant effect on the value of retention for different organisms. Wind damage also influences perception of the approach by resource managers and the public. This study quantified the extent of wind damage on forest edges, patches and dispersed individual trees after harvesting retention cutblocks. We also investigated the qualitative and quantitative factors associated with wind damage. The geographic distribution of the study facilitated evaluation of regional variation in windthrow. We sampled 172 harvested areas over a 6-year period from southern Vancouver Island (VI) to Haida Gwaii (Queen Charlotte Islands). The study showed regional differences in wind damage for cutblocks after 2–5 wind seasons. Wind damage was measured as the total percentage of windthrown trees, broken stems and leaning trees within 25 m of forest edges. Average wind damage to cutblock edges (16%) ranged from 11% on southern VI to 25% on the northwest coast of VI. There was a similar regional trend with wind damage to trees retained in large patches and in smaller groups. The average damage along the edges of retention patches over 1 ha (24%) was lowest for southern VI and the BC coastal mainland (16%) and highest for Haida Gwaii (45%). Wind damage to entire groups averaging 0.22 ha in size (37%) varied from 23 to 53% among study areas. For strips of retained timber, wind damage averaged 32% in the 25 m edge sampled. Windward edges were more vulnerable to windthrow than other boundary exposures and damage differed significantly among biogeoclimatic subzones. Topographically exposed locations such as ridge crests and upper slopes experienced more wind damage than middle and lower slopes. The amount of wind damage also increased with increasing stand height and fetch distance. The distance that windthrow penetrated a stand edge was affected by some of the same factors as percent damage. Penetration along cutblock edges varied regionally from 6 m to 20 m. Our results suggest that designing variable retention for local site, stand and wind exposure conditions can reduce the potential for wind damage.},

This study analyses the occurrence of wind and snow damage on Norwegian forests, based on data from four consecutive forest inventories (1995–2014). The methodological approach is based on boosted regression trees, a machine learning method aiming to demonstrate the effects of different variables on damage probability and their interactions as well as to spatialize damage occurrence to make predictions. In total, 313 models are fitted to detect trends, interactions and effects among the variables. The main variables associated with damage occurrence are consistent across all the models and include: latitude, altitude and slope (related to site and location), and tree density, mean diameter and height (related to forest characteristics). The results show that stand dominant height is a key variable in explaining damage probability, whereas stand slenderness has a limited effect. More heterogeneous forest structures make birch dominated stands more resistant to damage. Finally, the models are translated into occurrence maps, to provide landscape-level information on snow and wind damage hazard. Further application of the models can be oriented towards assessing the probability of damage for alternate stand management scenarios.},

   abstract = {One of the most significant challenges in developing a predictive understanding of the long-term effects of hurricanes on tropical forests is the development of quantitative models of the relationships between variation in storm intensity and the resulting severity of tree damage and mortality. There have been many comparative studies of interspecific variation in resistance of trees to wind damage based on aggregate responses to individual storms. We use a new approach, based on ordinal logistic regression, to fit quantitative models of the susceptibility of a tree species to different levels of damage across an explicit range of hurricane intensity. Our approach simultaneously estimates both the local intensity of the storm within a plot and the susceptibility to storm damage of different tree species within plots. Using the spatial variation of storm intensity embedded in two hurricanes (Hugo in 1989 and Georges in 1998) that struck the 16 ha Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot in eastern Puerto Rico, we show that variation in susceptibility to storm damage is an important aspect of life history differentiation. Pioneers such as Cecropia schreberiana are highly susceptible to stem damage, while the late successional species Dacryodes excelsa suffered very little stem damage but significant crown damage. There was a surprisingly weak relationship between tree diameter and the susceptibility to damage for most of the 12 species examined. This may be due to the effects of repeated storms and trade winds on the architecture of trees and forest stands in this Puerto Rican subtropical wet forest. © 2009 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.},

To address gaps in previous studies, we measured herbivory and defence in the same system, quantified defence with bioassays, and considered effects of leaf age. We quantified herbivory and defence of young and mature leaves along a continental gradient in eastern North America in the native herb Phytolacca americana L. Herbivory in the field declined with latitude and was strongly correlated with lepidopteran abundance. Laboratory bioassays revealed that leaf palatability was positively correlated with latitude of origin. Young leaves were more damaged than mature leaves at lower latitudes in the field, but less palatable in bioassays. Both defence and palatability displayed non-linear latitudinal patterns, suggesting potential mechanisms based on biological or climatic thresholds. In sum, observational and experimental studies find patterns consistent with high herbivore pressure and stronger plant defences at lower latitudes.},

   abstract = {The integration of functional traits into vulnerability assessments is a promising approach to quantitatively capture differences in species sensitivity and adaptive capacity to climate change, allowing the refinement of tree species distribution models. In response to a clear need to identify traits that are responsive to climate change and applicable in a management context, we review the state of knowledge of the main mechanisms, and their associated traits, that underpin the ability of boreal and temperate tree species to persist and (or) shift their distribution in a changing climate. We aimed to determine whether current knowledge is sufficiently mature and available to be used effectively in vulnerability assessments. Marshalling recent conceptual advances and assessing data availability, our ultimate objective is to guide modellers and practitioners in finding and selecting sets of traits that can be used to capture differences in species'ability to persist and migrate. While the physiological mechanisms that determine sensitivity to climate change are relatively well understood (e.g., drought-induced cavitation), many associated traits have not been systematically documented for North American trees and differences in methodology preclude their widespread integration into vulnerability assessments (e.g., xylem recovery capacity). In contrast, traits traditionally associated with the ability to migrate and withstand fire are generally well documented, but new key traits are emerging in the context of climate change that have not been as well characterized (e.g., age of optimum seed production). More generally, lack of knowledge surrounding the extent and patterns in intraspecific trait variation, as well as co-variation and interaction among traits, limit our ability to use this approach to assess tree adaptive capacity. We conclude by outlining research needs and potential strategies for the development of trait-based knowledge applicable in large-scale modelling efforts, sketching out important aspects of trait data organization that should be part of a coordinated effort by the forest science community.},

   abstract = {Conventional conservation policies in Europe notably rely on the passive restoration of natural forest dynamics by setting aside forest areas to preserve forest biodiversity. However, since forest reserves cover only a small proportion of the territory, conservation policies also require complementary conservation efforts in managed forests in order to achieve the biodiversity targets set up in the Convention on Biological Diversity. Conservation measures also raise the question of large herbivore management in and around set-asides, particularly regarding their impact on understory vegetation. Although many studies have separately analyzed the effects of forest management, management abandonment, and ungulate pressure on forest biodiversity, their joint effects have rarely been studied in a correlative framework. We studied 212 plots located in 15 strict forest reserves paired with adjacent managed forests in European France. We applied structural equation models to test the effects of management abandonment, stand structure, and ungulate pressure on the abundance, species richness, and diversity of herbaceous vascular plants and terricolous bryophytes. We showed that stand structure indices and plot-level browsing pressure had direct and opposite effects on herbaceous vascular plant species diversity; these effects were linked with the light tolerance of the different species groups. Increasing canopy cover had an overall negative effect on herbaceous vascular plant abundance and species diversity. The effect was two to three times greater in magnitude than the positive effects of browsing pressure on herbaceous plants diversity. On the other hand, a high stand density index had a positive effect on the species richness and diversity of bryophytes, while browsing had no effect. Forest management abandonment had few direct effects on understory plant communities, and mainly indirectly affected herbaceous vascular plant and bryophyte abundance and species richness and diversity through changes in vertical stand structure. Our results show that conservation biologists should rely on foresters and hunters to lead the preservation of understory vegetation communities in managed forests since, respectively, they manipulate stand structure and regulate ungulate pressure. Their management actions should be adapted to the taxa at stake, since bryophytes and vascular plants respond differently to stand and ungulate factors.},

   abstract = {Large-scale wildfires are expected to accelerate forest dieback in Amazônia, but the fire vulnerability of tree species remains uncertain, in part due to the lack of studies relating fire-induced mortality to both fire behavior and plant traits. To address this gap, we established two sets of experiments in southern Amazonia. First, we tested which bark traits best predict heat transfer rates (R) through bark during experimental bole heating. Second, using data from a large-scale fire experiment, we tested the effects of tree wood density (WD), size, and estimated R (inverse of cambium insulation) on tree mortality after one to five fires. In the first experiment, bark thickness explained 82% of the variance in R, while the presence of water in the bark reduced the difference in temperature between the heat source and the vascular cambium, perhaps because of high latent heat of vaporization. This novel finding provides an important insight for improving mechanistic models of fire-induced cambium damage from tropical to temperate regions. In the second experiment, tree mortality increased with increasing fire intensity (i.e. as indicated by bark char height on tree boles), which was higher along the forest edge, during the 2007 drought, and when the fire return interval was 3 years instead of one. Contrary to other tropical studies, the relationship between mortality and fire intensity was strongest in the year following the fires, but continued for 3 years afterwards. Tree mortality was low (≤20%) for thick-barked individuals (≥18 mm) subjected to medium-intensity fires, and significantly decreased as a function of increasing tree diameter, height and wood density. Hence, fire-induced tree mortality was influenced not only by cambium insulation but also by other traits that reduce the indirect effects of fire. These results can be used to improve assessments of fire vulnerability of tropical forests. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {Tree mortality is a fundamental process governing forest dynamics, but understanding tree mortality patterns is challenging because large, long-term datasets are required. Describing size-specific mortality patterns can be especially difficult, due to few trees in larger size classes. We used permanent plot data from Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides (mountain beech) forest on the eastern slopes of the Southern Alps, New Zealand, where the fates of trees on 250 plots of 0.04 ha were followed, to examine: (1) patterns of size-specific mortality over three consecutive periods spanning 30 years, each characterised by different disturbance, and (2) the strength and direction of neighbourhood crowding effects on size-specific mortality rates. We found that the size-specific mortality function was U-shaped over the 30-year period as well as within two shorter periods characterised by small-scale pinhole beetle and windthrow disturbance. During a third period, characterised by earthquake disturbance, tree mortality was less size dependent. Small trees (<20 cm in diameter) were more likely to die, in all three periods, if surrounded by a high basal area of larger neighbours, suggesting that size-asymmetric competition for light was a major cause of mortality. In contrast, large trees (≥20 cm in diameter) were more likely to die in the first period if they had few neighbours, indicating that positive crowding effects were sometimes important for survival of large trees. Overall our results suggest that temporal variability in size-specific mortality patterns, and positive interactions between large trees, may sometimes need to be incorporated into models of forest dynamics. © 2011 Hurst et al.},

Laws.) in the Black Hills following a large, mixed-severity wildfire. We measured tree morphology and direct fire effects on 963 trees and assessed individual tree mortality annually from 2001 to 2005. We used logistic regression to model tree mortality as a function of tree morphology (dbh) and bark thickness (BARK) and direct fire effects [percentage of the live crown scorched (PSCOR) and basal char measured as the percentage of the bole charred below 30 cm (CHAR)]. Models using dbh and BARK were modeled separately due to correlation between the variables. In all models, mortality decreased with increasing dbh and BARK and increased with increasing PSCOR and CHAR. Basal char contributed to the mortality of trees less than 40 cm but became less influential as dbh and BARK increased. Overall, probability of mortality modeled as a function of dbh, PSCOR, and CHAR correctly predicted the status of 78% of trees, whereas the model predicting mortality as a function of BARK, PSCOR, and CHAR had an increase in prediction accuracy of only 1%. FOR. SCI. 52(5):530-539. T HE ABILITY TO ACCURATELY PREDICT individual tree mortality following fire has important management implications. Whether a tree will live or die influences timber salvage operations that focus on removing trees immediately killed by fire or those trees that can be expected to die within a period of a few years following fire. The ability to predict postfire mortality provides managers insight into postfire forest structure and function and its relation to future timber production, changes in wildlife habitat, and long-term planning objectives. Decision-making criteria regarding postfire management operations need to be based on accurate and efficient postfire assessments. Of particular importance is information regarding delayed tree mortality as fire-killed trees are subject to insect and disease infestations (McHugh et al. 2003), rendering the timber unsalvageable. The issues and concerns over the potential ecological effects that postfire salvage operations have on forest recovery processes and future forest stand development (Lindenmayer et al. 2004, Purdon et al. 2004, Donato et al. 2006) along with the increased loss of timber from forests' timber base due to the increase in large-scale wildfires (Keegan et al. 2004), have emphasized the need to base postfire management decisions on accurate models of predicted postfire mortality. In this article we develop accurate and efficient models to predict the 5-year mortality of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex P. & C. Laws.) based on tree morphology, in particular tree size and bark thickness, and observed fire effects following a large, mixed-severity wildfire in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Individual tree mortality caused by fire is the result of direct heat or flame damage to the foliage (i.e., scorch and consumption), cambium, and root system, which disrupts tree physiological processes such as water transport, nutrient uptake, and photosynthesis (Ryan and Reinhardt 1988, Ryan et al. 1988, Swezy and Agee 1991). Tree morphology, in particular tree diameter, bark thickness, crown base height, and foliage density (Ryan and Reinhardt 1988) and prefire tree vigor (van Mantgem et al. 2003) all play a significant role in estimating the resistance of individual trees and tree species to fire-related injury and death. Dbh and bark thickness have an impact on the resistance of a tree to cambial injury and girdling (Vines 1968), whereas crown base height and foliage density influence the severity and degree of crown injury that directly affect bud survival and new shoot production, as well as postfire photosynthetic capacity (Wyant et al. 1983). The most important factor influencing postfire tree mortality is crown injury. Recent mortality studies have focused on the percentage of crown volume killed either by scorch and (or) consumption as an indicator of crown damage (Ryan and Reinhardt 1988, Stephens and Finney 2002,},

   abstract = {Traits such as resprouting, serotiny, and germination by heat and smoke are adaptive in fire-prone environments. However, plants are not adapted to fire per se but to fire regimes. Species can be threatened when humans alter the regime, often by increasing or decreasing fire frequency. Fire-adaptive traits are potentially the result of different evolutionary pathways. Distinguishing between traits that are adaptations originating in response to fire or exaptations originating in response to other factors might not always be possible. However, fire has been a factor throughout the history of land plant evolution and is not strictly a Neogene phenomenon. Mesozoic fossils show evidence of fire-adaptive traits and in some lineages these might have persisted to the present as fire adaptations. Adaptation to fire In a recent publication by S. Don Bradshaw et al. [1] concerns are raised about the widespread application of prescription burning in hotspots of biodiversity, and we share those concerns that too frequent prescription burning can negatively affect biodiversity and ecosystem processes. However, that paper inappropriately used this issue as a springboard for speculating on the evolution of plant traits, confusing issues of adaptive traits and adaptations, and missing the fact that different fire regimes can select for very different plant traits. No species is 'fire-adapted' but rather it is adapted to a particular fire regime, which among other things includes fire frequency, fire intensity, and patterns of fuel consumption [2]. Species that exhibit traits adaptive under a particular fire regime can be threatened when that regime changes. For example, many of the species-rich Mediterranean-type climate (MTC) shrublands are resilient to periodic high intensity crown fires at intervals of several decades or more. However, when fire frequency increases, species can be rapidly lost [3,4]. Bradshaw et al. [1] incorrectly equate adaptation to fire as adaptation to frequent fires and are not justified in inferring that frequent prescription burning is an "adaptationist view." Here we discuss those traits with apparent adaptive value in fire-prone environments, the extent to which we can demonstrate they are adaptations to fire, and address the question of what can fire adaptive traits and fire adaptations tell us about fire management. Adaptive traits Adaptive traits are those that provide a fitness advantage in a given environment. There are many plant traits that are of adaptive value in the face of recurrent fire and these vary markedly},

We gathered data from 22 wildfires (4585 trees) that occurred in three southern European countries (Portugal, Spain and France), covering a wide range of conditions characteristic of Q. suber ecosystems. Post-fire tree responses (tree mortality, stem mortality and crown resprouting) were examined in relation to management and ecological factors using generalized linear mixed-effects models. Results showed that bark thickness and bark harvesting are major factors affecting resistance of Q. suber to fire. Fire vulnerability was higher for trees with thin bark (young or recently debarked individuals) and decreased with increasing bark thickness until cork was 3-4 cm thick. This bark thickness corresponds to the moment when exploited trees are debarked again, meaning that exploited trees are vulnerable to fire during a longer period. Exploited trees were also more likely to be top-killed than unexploited trees, even for the same bark thickness. Additionally, vulnerability to fire increased with burn severity and with tree diameter, and was higher in trees burned in early summer or located in drier south-facing aspects. We provided tree response models useful to help estimating the impact of fire and to support management decisions. The results suggested that an appropriate management of surface fuels and changes in the bark harvesting regime (e.g. debarking coexisting trees in different years or increasing the harvesting cycle) would decrease vulnerability to fire and contribute to the conservation of cork oak ecosystems. © 2012 Catry et al.},

   abstract = {The reintroduction of fire to historically fire-prone forests has been repeatedly shown to reduce understory fuels and promote resistance to high severity fire. However, there is concern that prescribed fire may also have unintended consequences, such as high rates of mortality for large trees and fire-tolerant Pinus species. To test this possibility we evaluated mortality patterns for two common genera in the western US, Pinus and Abies, using observations from a national-scale prescribed fire effects monitoring program. Our results show that mortality rates of trees >50 DBH were similar for Pinus (4.6% yr-1) and Abies (4.0% yr-1) 5years following prescribed fires across seven sites in the southwestern US. In contrast, mortality rates of trees ≤50cm DBH differed between Pinus (5.7% yr-1) and Abies (9.0% yr-1). Models of post-fire mortality probabilities suggested statistically significant differences between the genera (after including differences in bark thickness), but accounting for these differences resulted in only small improvements in model classification. Our results do not suggest unusually high post-fire mortality for large trees or for Pinus relative to the other common co-occurring genus, Abies, following prescribed fire in the southwestern US. © 2012.},

   abstract = {To recruit to reproductive size in fire-prone savannas, juvenile trees must avoid stem mortality (topkill) by fire. Theory suggests they either grow tall, raising apical buds above the flames, or wide, buffering the stem from fire. However, growing tall or wide is of no advantage without stem protection from fire. In Litchfield National Park, northern Australia, we explored the importance of bark thickness to stem survival following fire in a eucalypt-dominated tropical savanna.We measured bark thickness, prefire height, stem diameter and resprouting responses of small stems under conditions of low to moderate fire intensity. Fire induced mortality was low (<10%), topkill was uncommon (<11% of 5 m to 37% of 1 m tall stems) and epicormic resprouting was common. Topkill was correlated only with absolute bark thickness and not with stem height or width. Thus, observed height and diameter growth responses of small stems are likely different pathways to achieving bark thick enough to protect buds and the vascular cambium. Juvenile height was traded off against the cost of thick bark, so that wide stems were short with thicker bark for a given height. The fire resilience threshold for bark thickness differed between tall (4-5 mm) and wide individuals (8-9 mm), yet tall stems had lower PTopkill for a given bark thickness. Trends in PTopkill reflected eucalypt versus non-eucalypt differences. Eucalypts had thinner bark than non-eucalypts but lower PTopkill.With deeply embedded epicormic buds eucalypts do not need thick bark to protect buds and can allocate resources to height growth. Our data suggest the only 'strategy' for avoiding topkill in fireprone systems is to optimise bark thickness to maximise stem bud and cambium protection. Thus, escape height is the height at which bark protects the stem and a wide stem per se is insufficient protection from fire without thick bark. Consequently, absolute bark thickness is crucial to explanations of species differences in topkill, resprouting response and tree community composition in fire-prone savannas. Bark thickness and the associated mechanism of bud protection offer a proximate explanation for the dominance of eucalypts in Australian tropical savannas. © 2011 Lawes et al.},

   abstract = {Relationships between the flammability properties of a given plant and its chances of survival after a fire still remain unknown. We hypothesize that the bark flammability of a tree reduces the potential for tree survival following surface fires, and that if tree resistance to fire is provided by a thick insulating bark, the latter must be few flammable. We test, on subalpine tree species, the relationship between the flammability of bark and its insulating ability, identifies the biological traits that determine bark flammability, and assesses their relative susceptibility to surface fires from their bark properties. The experimental set of burning properties was analyzed by Principal Component Analysis to assess the bark flammability. Bark insulating ability was expressed by the critical time to cambium kill computed from bark thickness. Log-linear regressions indicated that bark flammability varies with the bark thickness and the density of wood under bark and that the most flammable barks have poor insulating ability. Susceptibility to surface fires increases from gymnosperm to angiosperm subalpine trees. The co-dominant subalpine species Larix decidua (Mill.) and Pinus cembra (L.) exhibit large differences in both flammability and insulating ability of the bark that should partly explain their contrasted responses to fires in the past. © 2013 Frejaville, Curt and Carcaillet.},

   abstract = {Postfire tree mortality is typically characterized using regression approaches that do not consider the causal processes linking fire behavior and tree mortality. Recently, a growing number of studies has used biophysical process approaches that attempt to define and independently validate these causal processes. Nevertheless, some foresters and ecologists are unfamiliar with the approach and it remains a minority in fire ecology research. The purpose of this review is to describe in straightforward terms the fundamental biophysical processes that link fire behavior to tree mortality. The review begins with a brief introduction to heat transfer theory before moving on to combustion processes and forest fire behavior. A discussion follows on how fire behavior is linked to injuries in the tree roots, bole and crown, and finally a biophysical process framework for linking root, bole and crown injuries to tree mortality is outlined. It is hoped that this overview will promote future process approaches and help to produce more predictive and general models of postfire tree mortality. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.},

   abstract = {Drought is a global threat, increasing in severity and frequency throughout tropical ecosystems. Although plants often face drought in conjunction with biotic stressors, such as herbivory or disease, experimental studies infrequently test the simultaneous effects of drought and biotic stress. Because multiple simultaneous stressors may have non-additive and complex effects on plant performance, it is difficult to predict plant responses to multiple threats from research examining one stress at a time. Using an experimental approach in the greenhouse, we investigated potential non-additivity in seedling growth and survival to simulated drought and herbivory across a phylogenetically diverse pool of ten Hawaiian plant species. Overall, seedlings showed limited tolerance, defined as similar growth and survival in stressed compared with control (non-stressed) plants, to simulated herbivory and drought, with the combined effects of both stressors to be generally additive and negative across species. Significant variation in stress tolerance was detected among species, and species variation was explained, at least in part, by functional traits such that species with larger root/shoot ratios and smaller seeds, tended to demonstrate greater herbivory and drought tolerance. Future research incorporating additional trait analysis and different stressors could shed light on mechanisms underlying seedling stress tolerance and clarify whether additivity, as detected in this study, extends across other combinations of stressors. Such work will provide needed insights into the regeneration of seedlings in tropical forests under threats of herbivory and climate change.},

   abstract = {Plant traits—the morphological, anatomical, physiological, biochemical and phenological characteristics of plants—determine how plants respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels, and influence ecosystem properties and their benefits and detriments to people. Plant trait data thus represent the basis for a vast area of research spanning from evolutionary biology, community and functional ecology, to biodiversity conservation, ecosystem and landscape management, restoration, biogeography and earth system modelling. Since its foundation in 2007, the TRY database of plant traits has grown continuously. It now provides unprecedented data coverage under an open access data policy and is the main plant trait database used by the research community worldwide. Increasingly, the TRY database also supports new frontiers of trait-based plant research, including the identification of data gaps and the subsequent mobilization or measurement of new data. To support this development, in this article we evaluate the extent of the trait data compiled in TRY and analyse emerging patterns of data coverage and representativeness. Best species coverage is achieved for categorical traits—almost complete coverage for ‘plant growth form’. However, most traits relevant for ecology and vegetation modelling are characterized by continuous intraspecific variation and trait–environmental relationships. These traits have to be measured on individual plants in their respective environment. Despite unprecedented data coverage, we observe a humbling lack of completeness and representativeness of these continuous traits in many aspects. We, therefore, conclude that reducing data gaps and biases in the TRY database remains a key challenge and requires a coordinated approach to data mobilization and trait measurements. This can only be achieved in collaboration with other initiatives.},

   abstract = {Climate change may directly induce shifts in stand-level dynamics by altering the regeneration, growth and mortality of tree species, and indirectly by modifying interspecific competition. While some experimental and simulation studies have shown that these effects can be compensated by lower browsing pressure, it is not clear how species composition and stand basal area may respond in the short and long term, and to which extent.We investigated the response of forests to isolated and combined changes of climatic conditions and ungulate browsing intensity in the Bavarian Forest National Park (BFNP), a strictly protected forest reserve. To this aim, we firstly characterized the browsing variability within the BFNP and among each tree species. Based on this, we implemented new equations in the forest gap model ForClim v3.0 and simulated the short- and long-term development of different forest types according to pertinent scenarios of browsing intensity.The model predicted a large dieback of the dominant Picea abies and Abies alba due to the increase in summer drought and winter temperatures; these species were progressively replaced by Fagus sylvatica. While climate change may have a positive impact on tree diversity in the short term (~100. years), long-term simulations (>1000. years) revealed reduced tree diversity and stand basal area compared to those predicted under current climate. While species composition was strongly dependent on browsing intensity under current climate through the changes in seedling selectivity by ungulates and in light regimes, the trajectory of vegetation development under climate change was not significantly altered by browsing. Even for highly palatable species such as A. alba, an eradication of ungulates could not compensate the decline of drought-intolerant species.We conclude that forest management tools to reduce ungulates population may be helpful to promote species diversity in P. abies dominated forest. However they may not be sufficient to compensate for the reduction in basal area and diversity that is induced by climate change. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {As a consequence of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, climate change is predicted to be particularly pronounced, although regionally variable, in the vast arctic, sub-arctic and alpine tundra areas of the northern hemisphere. Here, we review winter foraging conditions for reindeer and caribou (Rangifer tarandus) living in these areas, and consider diet, forage quality and distribution, accessibility due to snow variation, and effects of snow condition on reindeer and caribou populations. Finally, we hypothesise how global warming may affect wild mountain reindeer herds in South Norway. Energy-rich lichens often dominate reindeer and caribou diets. The animals also prefer lichens, and their productivity has been shown to be higher on lichen-rich than on lichen-poor ranges. Nevertheless, this energy source appears to be neither sufficient as winter diet for reindeer or caribou (at least for pregnant females) nor necessary. Some reindeer and caribou populations seem to be better adapted to a non-lichen winter diet, e.g. by a larger alimentary tract. Shrubs appear to be the most common alternative winter forage, while some grasses appear to represent a good, nutritionally-balanced winter diet. Reindeer/caribou make good use of a wide variety of plants in winter , including dead and dry parts that are digested more than expected based on their fibre content. The diversity of winter forage is probably important for the mineral content of the diet. A lichen-dominated winter diet may be deficient in essential dietary elements, e.g. minerals. Sodium in particular may be marginal in inland winter ranges. Our review indicates that most Rangifer populations with lichen-dominated winter diets are either periodically or continuously heavily harvested by humans or predators. However, when population size is mainly limited by food, accessible lichen resources are often depleted. Plant studies simulating climatic change indicate that a warmer, wetter climate may cause an altitudinal upward shift in the production of mat-forming lichens in alpine, sub-arctic regions. This is due to an increased potential for lichen growth at high altitudes, combined with increased competition from taller-growing vascular plants at lower altitudes, where the biomass of Betula nana in particular will increase. Mat-forming lichens dominant on dry, windblown ridges are easily overgrazed at high reindeer densities. This has long-term effects due to lichens' slow regeneration rate, but may also reduce competition from vascular plants in a long time perspective. Fires may act in a similar way in some forested areas. Accessibility of winter forage depends on plant biomass, snow depth and hardness; ice crusts or exceptionally deep snow may result in starvation and increased animal mortality. Calf recruitment appears to be low and/or highly variable where winter ranges are overgrazed and hard or deep snow is common. Population decline in several Rangifer tarandus spp. has been associated with snow-rich winters. Effects tend to be delayed and cumulative, particularly on calves. This is mainly ascribed to feeding conditions for young animals which later affect age at maturation. Global warming may increase the frequency of deep or hard snow on reindeer ranges in Norway, due to increased precipitation and more frequent mild periods in winter. We hypothesise that potential benefits from increased plant productivity due to global warming will be counteracted by shifts in the distribution of preferred lichen forage, reduction of the areas of suitable winter ranges, and generally reduced forage accessibility in winter.},

   abstract = {Mammalian predator-prey systems are behaviorally sophisticated games of stealth and fear. But, traditional mass-action models of predator prey dynamics treat individuals as behav-iorally unresponsive "molecules" in Brownian motion. Foraging theory should provide the conceptual framework to envision the interaction. But, current models of predator feeding behavior generally envision a clever predator consuming large numbers of sessile and behaviorally inert prey (e.g., kangaroo rats, Dipodomys, collecting seeds from food patches). Here, we extend foraging theory to consider a predator-prey game of stealth and fear and then embed this game into the modeling of predator-prey population dynamics. The melding of the prey and predator's optimal behaviors with their population and community level consequences constitutes the ecology of fear. The ecology of fear identifies the endpoints of a continuum of N-driven (population size) versus j.L-driven (fear) systems. In N-driven systems, the major direct dynamical feedback involves predators killing prey, whereas)..L-driven systems involve the indirect effects from changes in fear levels and prey catchability. In j.L-driven systems, prey respond to predators by becoming more vigilant or by moving away from suspected predators. In this way, a predator (e.g., mountain lion, Puma concolor) depletes a\{ood patch (e.g., local herd of mule deer, Odocoi/eus hemionus) by frightening prey rather than by actually killing prey. Behavior buffers the system: a reduction in predator numbers should rapidly engender less vigilant and more catchable prey. The ecology of fear explains why big fierce carnivores should be and can be rare. In carnivore systems, ignore the behavioral game at one's peril. There have been two complementary but somewhat divergent approaches to predator prey interactions. Each approach focus-es on different aspects of the interaction. The first (Taylor, 1984) focuses on predators killing prey; predators are lethal. The second (Lima and Dill, 1990) focuses on fierce predators scaring their prey; prey treat predation risk as an activity cost and respond accordingly. In fact, fierceness is not a property of the' predator but rather a property of the prey. If prey exhibit conspicuous fear responses to their predator, the predator is deemed fierce. The first approach has given rise to mod-Journal of Mammaiofl\}'. 80(2):385-399, 1999 385 els of predator-prey population dynamics (Hassell, 1978; Murdoch and Oaten, 1975; Rosenzweig and MacArthur, 1963). In such models, predators influence population size of the prey and may influence number and stability properties of equilibrium points. Rarely, however, do these models consider the prey's behavioral response to the pred-ator's presence. Ignorance of behavioral responses may result in large deviations between the model's predictions and empirical outcomes. These deviations may be particularly acute for large mammalian predator-prey systems where prey and predator respond to each other in behaviorally sophis},

   abstract = {Limited knowledge is available about the growth of Norway spruce saplings related to spring climate, especially snow duration, in subalpine forests. The primary goal of this research was to quantify the relative importance of the direct and indirect drivers of growth for spruce saplings in subalpine forests that are related to spring climate. Two related, subordinate goals were to compare the statistical power of different growth indices for saplings, and to evaluate differences among model accuracy and strength of predictors for saplings stratified into three height classes. During the 2002 and 2003 field seasons we conducted an observation study in the subalpine forests of Davos and Sedrun, Switzerland. We measured growth and local light availability, spring climate, and snow environment for 634 spruce saplings. Tree size, spring snow duration, overstory canopy cover and elevation were among the most important variables related to annual height growth (R2 = 0.35), primary growth (of the main stem and upper branches, R2 = 0.44), and crown volume growth (R2 = 0.80) of saplings. In addition, the presence of black snow mold (Herpotrichia nigra) was important for height and primary growth. Crown volume growth of trees stratified into height classes explained more variability than height or primary growth models, with R2-values of 0.43 for trees 10-30 cm tall (A), 0.32 for trees 31-60 cm (B), and 0.51 for trees 61-130 cm (C). Primary growth models for A and C-size class trees had moderate R2-values of 0.37 and 0.36, respectively. Growth of A-size trees was primarily related to canopy cover and spring snow duration. While for B-size trees it was difficult to capture aboveground growth, this group responded more to the presence of snow mold than the other groups. Growth of C-size trees was correlated well with the availability of direct light, snow duration, and slope orientation. We conclude that in addition to the other environmental predictors mentioned, spring climate and especially snow duration matter for the growth of Norway spruce saplings in subalpine forests. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

While complex problems with these stands are widely recognised, methods to regenerate or convert them to mixed stands are not yet well established. The purpose of this study was to determine favourable combinations of site factors (diffuse solar radiation (DIFF) and direct solar radiation (DIR), forest ground vegetation cover, thickness of humus horizons, browsing) for development of tree regeneration within gaps of different size and age, located in a Norway spruce plantation on a silver ®r (Abies alba Mill.) and common beech (Fagus silvatica L.) forest site. Fifteen fenced and ®fteen unfenced gaps with nine plots each were placed on the north slope of Mount Krasica, in the mountain vegetation belt, on limestone parent material. From 1993 to 1998 woody seedlings and saplings were observed. A successful development of Norway spruce, sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) and other frequently seed-bearing broad leaves was determined for the ®rst years. Further development of seedlings was hindered by dense forest ground vegetation and browsing impact. Beech and silver ®r regeneration was insuf®cient due to a lack of seed-bearing trees. On the basis of direct and DIFF radiation four groups of microsites were separated. This satisfactorily explained the differences in regeneration patterns among tree species. Norway spruce seedlings were most frequent in the group with high levels of diffuse and low levels of DIR, while sycamore saplings were most frequent in the group with high levels of both radiation components. Results obtained suggest that natural regeneration success and composition can be successfully in¯uenced by managing the incidence of radiation in context with gap geometry (shape, size and orientation). #},

The main objective of this paper is to review documented evidence of the impacts of climate change trends on forest productivity since the middle of the 20th century. We first present a concise overview of the climate controls of forest production, provide evidence of how the main controls have changed in the last 55 years, followed by a core section outlining our findings of observed and documented impacts on forest productivity and a brief discussion of the complications of interpreting trends in net primary production (NPP). At finer spatial scales, a trend is difficult to decipher, but globally, based on both satellite and ground-based data, climatic changes seemed to have a generally positive impact on forest productivity when water was not limiting. Of the 49 papers reporting forest production levels we reviewed, 37 showed a positive growth trend, five a negative trend, three reported both a positive and a negative trend for different time periods, one reported a positive and no trend for different geographic areas, and two reported no trend. Forests occupy ≈ 52% of the Earth's land surface and tend to occupy more temperature and radiation-limited environments. Less than 7% of forests are in strongly water-limited systems. The combined and interacting effects of temperature, radiation, and precipitation changes with the positive effect of CO2, the negative effects of O3 and other pollutants, and the presently positive effects of N will not be elucidated with experimental manipulation of one or a few factors at a time. Assessments of the greening of the biosphere depend on both accurate measurements of rates (net ecosystem exchange, NPP), how much is stored at the ecosystem level (net ecosystem production) and quantification of disturbances rates on final net biome production. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

In New Zealand, deer were introduced during the nineteenth century, causing dramatic changes to the understory composition and structure of some forests. Deer prefer to browse on short tree species, mostly associated with early successional stands and moist-fertile sites, but many tall tree species are browsed only when other food sources are scarce. The government has invested heavily in control programs aimed at reducing deer numbers and thereby restoring forests to something approaching their preinvasion composition and structure, but have met with only limited success. Based on a literature review, we give several examples of situations in which deer impacts may not be reversible, including the following: (1) palatable species remaining highly browsed even at low deer densities as a result of diet switching; (2) occupation of vacated niches by plant species not eaten by deer; (3) local extinction of seed sources; (4) fundamental alterations to successional pathways ; (5) shifts in ecosystem processes; (6) other exotic animals becoming naturalized and weakening the effectiveness of single-species control; and (7) exotic plants weakening the effectiveness of single-species control. We consider the contributions that scientific research can make to effective forest restoration, including empirically based forest-dynamics models that place regeneration in the context of other processes, such as disturbance , soil fertility, and multiple invasive organisms. Factores que Previenen la Recuperación de Bosques de Nueva Zelanda Después del Control del Venado Invasor Resumen: Actualmente hay un gran interés en restaurar los ecosistemas afectados por organismos invasores. En Nueva Zelanda los venados fueron introducidos durante el siglo diecinueve causando cambios dramáticos en la composición del sotobosque y en la estructura de algunos bosques. El venado prefiere ramonear especies de árboles bajos, principalmente asociadas a sitios de sucesión temprana, húmedos y fértiles, pero muchas es-pecies de árboles altos son ramoneados cuando escasean otras fuentes de alimentos. El gobierno ha hecho grandes inversiones en programas de control dirigidos a restaurar el bosque a su composición y estructura pre-vias a la invasión, reduciendo el número de venados, sin embargo, el éxito ha sido limitado. En base a una revisión bibliográfica, presentamos varios ejemplos de situaciones en las que los impactos de los venados pueden no ser reversibles. Estos incluyen losiguiente: (1) las especies apetecibles para los venados permanecen altamente ramoneadas aún a bajas densidades de venados, debido a cambios en la dieta; (2) la ocupación de nichos vacíos por especies de plantas que no son consumidas por los venados; (3) la extinción local de fuentes de semillas; (4) las alteraciones fundamentales a las vías sucesionales; (5) los cambios en los procesos eco-sistémicos; (6) otros organismos exóticos se han naturalizado y han debilitado la efectividad del control de una sola especie; y (7) las plantas exóticas debilitan la efectividad del control de una sola especie.

We show that declining snowpack strengthens the impacts of a generalist herbivore, elk (Cervus elaphus), on a common tree species. Thick snowpack substantially reduces elk visitation to sites; aspen (Populus tremuloides) shoots in these areas experience lower browsing rates, higher survival and enhanced recruitment. Aspen inside herbivore exclosures have greatly increased recruitment, particularly at sites with thick snowpack. We suggest that long-term decreases in snowpack could help explain a widespread decline of aspen through previously unconsidered relationships. More generally, reduced snowpack across the Rocky Mountains, combined with rising elk populations, may remove the conditions needed for recruitment of this ecologically important tree species. These results highlight that herbivore behavioural responses to altered abiotic conditions are critical determinants of plant persistence.

Tree seedlings, as the potential future overstory, are responding to the selective pressures of both mean and extreme conditions. We investigated how increases in mean temperature and the occurrence of late spring frosts affect emergence, development, growth, and survival of 13 native and non-native broadleaf and conifer tree species common in central Europe. Three temperature levels (ambient, +3, and +6 °C) and three spring frost treatments (control, late, and very late) were applied. Development responses of first-year seedlings to warmer temperatures were similar in direction and magnitude for broadleaf and conifer species. Stem size also increased with rising mean temperature for most species, though broadleaf species had maximal height advantage over conifer species in the warmest treatment. Sensitivity to frost differed sharply between the broadleaf and conifer groups. Broadleaf survival and stem length exhibited strong reductions due to frost events while conifer species only showed minor decreases in survival. Importantly, more rapid development and earlier leaf-out in response to warmer temperatures were associated with increased mortality from frost for broadleaf species but decreased mortality for conifer species. This research suggests that compositional shifts in the direction of species favored by increasing mean temperatures may be slowed by extreme events, and thus, the occurrence and impacts of such weather events must be acknowledged and incorporated into research and forest planning. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Vegetation relevés sampled in the Göttinger Wald, southern Lower Saxony, Germany, between 1955 and 1960 (n = 25) and in 1968 (n = 10) were re-surveyed in 2009 on quasi-permanent plots. Differences in species composition, species abundance and vegetation structure were compared between inventories using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), multiple response per- mutation procedure (MRPP) and the Wilcoxon signed ranks test. Forty to fifty years ago, a shrub layer was scarcely present, but is common today as a consequence of intensified hunting. An increasing abundance of Allium ursinum, Urtica dioica and Sambucus ni- gra and a general shift to species composition with higher Ellenberg indicator values for nitrogen can be ascribed to atmospheric nitro- gen deposition. The spring geophytes A. ursinum, Corydalis cava and Leucojum vernum can also benefit from global climate change with an earlier start of the vegetation period. A shift towards more oceanic conditions, with mild winters in the past fifty years, may also have increased the competitive strength of evergreen species that are susceptible to long frost periods (e.g. Hedera helix). The re- sampling of the beech forest vegetation on limestone revealed that many factors have influenced the dynamics over the past half cen- tury. These include eutrophication and a reduction in roe deer browsing, but our results also indicate a possible influence of climate change on community composition. In focussing on a small dataset from a very rich sub-unit of beech forests on limestone, the posi- tive response of the spring geophytes becomes particularly obvious.},

In some areas, this process leads to massive mortalities that can reduce or even completely prevent the regeneration of some tree species. Mediterranean mountain forests have undergone during the last decades important changes in land-uses that have significantly altered the type and abundance of herbivore populations. In this study we assessed the impact of current grazing conditions in forest regeneration using a set of experimental plantations established in the Eastern Pyrenees in areas visited by domestic livestock (cattle and horses) and wild ungulates (mainly roe deer and chamois). We analyzed during 4. years the role of seedling species and size, mesohabitat (elevation and type of forest cover) and microhabitat (herbaceous cover, distance to shrub, and light availability) on the browsing-induced mortality of more than 500 seedlings of Pinus sylvestris, Pinus uncinata, Betula pendula and Abies alba, the most common tree species in the study area. Browsing-induced mortality for the three conifer species was much lower (<15%) than the one observed for B. pendula (>40%) and depended on both microhabitat - mainly on the distance to protective elements such as shrubs; and mesohabitat, with an interaction between the elevational belt (site) and the type of forest cover (gaps vs. understory). In the subalpine belt, browsing on A. alba and P. uncinata was higher during summer at plots located in the forest understory whereas, during winter, it was higher at plots located in gaps. The study shows that both mesohabitat and microhabitat can exert an effect on the patterns of plant damage by herbivores, providing useful information to adapt forest management in areas particularly exposed to them.},

   abstract = {1. The idea that biotic interactions, including herbivory, predation and competition are more intense at lower latitudes is widely accepted and underpins several dominant theories on the latitudinal gradient in biodiversity. Current theory also predicts that the intense biotic interactions at low latitudes will select plants for greater defence against herbivores. We reviewed the literature to provide an assessment of the evidence for and against the hypothesis that herbivory is more intense at lower latitudes, and that plants from low latitudes are better defended than are plants from high latitudes. 2.Only 37% of the 38 latitudinal comparisons of herbivory showed higher herbivory at lower latitudes, and the average effect size in a meta-analysis was not significantly different from zero. Thus, the available data do not support the idea that herbivory is generally more intense in the tropics. 3.Only nine of 56 comparisons found higher chemical defences at lower latitudes, and a meta-analysis showed that overall, chemical defences were significantly higher in plants from higher latitudes. This result is counter to the predictions of much of the literature. 4.A meta-analysis showed no significant effect of latitude on physical defence. 5.A review of the literature on feeding trials and common garden experiments showed that herbivores tend to prefer tissue from high latitudes. This trend could stem from differences in overall defence that were not captured by the metrics used in the literature, but could also result from differences in nutritional quality. 6.The empirical data do not support the widespread view that herbivory is generally more intense at lower latitudes, or that plants from low latitudes are generally better defended than are plants from higher latitudes. These results are counter to the prevailing thought on this topic, and suggest that this field may be ripe for the development of new theory. © 2010 The Authors.

   abstract = {We developed interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas (excluding Antarctica) at a spatial resolution of 30 arc s (often referred to as 1-km spatial resolution). The climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. Input data were gathered from a variety of sources and, where possible, were restricted to records from the 1950-2000 period. We used the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in the ANUSPLIN package for interpolation, using latitude, longitude, and elevation as independent variables. We quantified uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. Elevation bias tended to be negative (stations lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the tropics. Uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in poorly sampled areas. Data partitioning showed high uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in the Pacific. Aggregating the elevation and climate data to 10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution surfaces. A comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc min resolution showed overall agreement, but with significant variation in some regions. A comparison with two high-resolution data sets for the United States also identified areas with large local differences, particularly in mountainous areas. Compared to previous global climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or more); more weather station records were used; improved elevation data were used; and more information about spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available. Owing to the overall low density of available climate stations, our surfaces do not capture of all variation that may occur at a resolution of 1 km, particularly of precipitation in mountainous areas. In future work, such variation might be captured through knowledge-based methods and inclusion of additional co-variates, particularly layers obtained through remote sensing.

   abstract = {The cryosphere in mountain regions is rapidly declining, a trend that is expected to accelerate over the next several decades due to anthropogenic climate change. A cascade of effects will result, extending from mountains to lowlands with associated impacts on human livelihood, economy, and ecosystems. With rising air temperatures and increased radiative forcing, glaciers will become smaller and, in some cases, disappear, the area of frozen ground will diminish, the ratio of snow to rainfall will decrease, and the timing and magnitude of both maximum and minimum streamflow will change. These changes will affect erosion rates, sediment, and nutrient flux, and the biogeochemistry of rivers and proglacial lakes, all of which influence water quality, aquatic habitat, and biotic communities. Changes in the length of the growing season will allow low-elevation plants and animals to expand their ranges upward. Slope failures due to thawing alpine permafrost, and outburst floods from glacier- and moraine-dammed lakes will threaten downstream populations. Societies even well beyond the mountains depend on meltwater from glaciers and snow for drinking water supplies, irrigation, mining, hydropower, agriculture, and recreation. Here, we review and, where possible, quantify the impacts of anticipated climate change on the alpine cryosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere, and consider the implications for adaptation to a future of mountains without permanent snow and ice.},

   abstract = {Plant-herbivore interactions occur in all ecosystems and provide a major avenue for energy flow to higher trophic levels. A long-standing hypothesis to explain the latitudinal gradient in species diversity proposes that the relatively stable and frost-free climate of the tropics should lead to more intense biotic interactions in tropical compared with temperate environments, giving rise to a greater diversity of plants and herbivores. Herbivory rates have been compared across latitudes to test this biotic interactions hypothesis, with herbivory typically being measured from observable leaf damage. However, we argue that a measure of percentage leaf damage alone does not straightforwardly reflect the cost of herbivory to the plant, and on its own does not constitute an appropriate test of the biotic interactions hypothesis. For a given amount of herbivory, the impact of herbivory is dependent upon many factors, such as the construction cost of the leaf, the growth and replacement rates and leaf life span. We investigate the latitudinal gradient in herbivory by analysing a large dataset of herbivory rates for 452 tree species and separating the species into those with short and long leaf life spans. We show that annual herbivory rates tend to be greater at lower latitudes for evergreen species (which have long-lived leaves), but no trend in herbivory rate with latitude was found for species with short leaf life spans. Phylogenetic least squares regression assuming Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes also showed a negative effect of latitude on herbivory rate for evergreen trees, but we caution that viewing herbivory as a species trait is problematic. An integrative approach that incorporates leaf life span, as well as the costs of investment in growth and potential costs of losing leaf tissue, is needed to further our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of herbivory.},

   abstract = {Browsing by ungulates is often reported as one of the major hazards for tree regeneration, e.g. in sites disturbed by windthrow and bark beetles. As tree regeneration in mountain forests is typically concentrated on suitable microsite types, the question arises how browsing is distributed in snag stands (e.g. in standing dead Norway spruce stands), i.e. if browsing is reduced or even impeded in some microsites. Furthermore, we wanted to determine whether logs could be considered as obstacles for ungulates, and thus whether they could protect tree regeneration. The distribution of Picea abies saplings and the impact of browsing were investigated in snag stands on the Gandberg in the Swiss Alps. The frequency of microsite types was assessed along 128 m× 10 m long lines on four elevational levels. Around these lines, in 2 m wide strip transects the height and shoot lengths of P. abies saplings were measured, and the microsite type on which they occurred was noted together with the distance to the next log, and damage due to browsing. Microsite types had a large influence on the abundance of P. abies saplings on the snag stands in the Gandberg mountain forests, i.e. the following microsite types had, in comparison to their occurrence, disproportionately many P. abies saplings: coarse woody debris, roots and boulders covered with mosses on the subalpine level, and on the montane level Polytrichum and Hylocomium cushions, and moss covered by Rubus idaeus. In contrast, sites with ferns, grasses and dense Rubus cover were poorly regenerated. Browsing was higher on the montane than on the subalpine level, regardless of the microsite types and the proximity of logs. Shrubs and logs did not reduce the browsing intensity. In contrast, more Picea saplings were browsed close or under logs than far away from logs on the montane level. Hence, logs cannot be considered as obstacles for chamois in these snag stands. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Climate warming is expected to induce movement of species upslope and towards higher latitudes. However, the mechanisms and physiological processes behind the altitudinal and latitudinal distribution range of a tree species are complex and depend on each tree species features and vary over ontogenetic stages. We investigated the altitudinal distribution differences between juvenile and adult individuals of seven major European tree species along elevational transects covering a wide latitudinal range from southern Spain (37°N) to northern Sweden (67°N). By comparing juvenile and adult distributions (shifts on the optimum position and the range limits) we assessed the response of species to present climate conditions in relation to previous conditions that prevailed when adults were established. Mean temperature increased by 0.86 °C on average at our sites during the last decade compared with previous 30-year period. Only one of the species studied, Abies alba, matched the expected predictions under the observed warming, with a maximum abundance of juveniles at higher altitudes than adults. Three species, Fagus sylvatica, Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris, showed an opposite pattern while for other three species, such as Quercus ilex, Acer pseudoplatanus and Q. petraea, we were no able to detect changes in distribution. These findings are in contrast with theoretical predictions and show that tree responses to climate change are complex and are obscured not only by other environmental factors but also by internal processes related to ontogeny and demography. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

   abstract = {Foraging efficiency (metabolizable energy intake I energy expenditure when foraging) was determined over a 2-year period in nine free-ranging Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis) in Alaska, and related to foraging-bout duration, distances travelled, and average speeds of travel. We calculated the energy-intake component from seasonal dry matter and energy content, dry matter digestibility, and a metabolizable energy coefficient for each plant species ingested. We estimated energy expenditures when foraging as the sum of energy costs of standing, horizontal and vertical locomotion, sinking depths in snow, and supplementary expenditures associated with temperatures outside thermoneutrality. Energy intake per minute averaged 4.0 times more in summer than winter; energy expenditure was 1.2 times greater in summer. Animals obtained higher amounts of metabolizable energy with higher amounts of energy invested. Energy intake during foraging bouts in summer was 2.5 times the energy invested; in contrast, energy intake during winter was only 0.7 times the energy expended. Changes in body mass of deer throughout the year increased asymptotically with foraging efficiency, driven primarily by the rate of metabolizable energy intake. Within a season, summer intake rates and winter rates of energy expediture had the greatest effects on the relation between foraging efficiency and mass status. Seasonal changes in foraging efficiency result in seasonal cycles in body mass and condition in black-tailed deer. Body reserves accumulated during summer, however, are essential for over-winter survival of north-temperate ungulates because energy demands cannot be met by foraging alone.

   abstract = {Mammals can influence growth, reproduction, competitive ability, and survival of woody plants by virtue of selective browsing and gnawing of dormant shoots during winter. Apparently in response to this type of herbivory, plants have evolved chemical and mechanical deterrents to mammalian herbivores. We report on plant ontogeny and biogeography, which exert their influence on herbivory at different spatiotemporal scales. To evaluate how plant ontogeny influences herbivory, we conducted a meta-analysis of 128 studies, encompassing 37 plant and 10 mammal species, in which juvenile and mature growth stages of conspecific plants were made available to mammals during winter in temperate and northern latitudes. Mammals ate more of the mature-stage growth in 96% of the studies, and stage-specific differences in consumption were very large (d 2.16). Plants characterized by rapid growth rates or low tolerances to resource limitation elicited the greatest degree of stage-specific discrimination by mammals, consistent with existing theories regarding tradeoffs governing plant growth and defense. The influence of a plant's growth rate and tolerance to resource limitation was dependent on climatic regime; plants grown in areas with harsh winter conditions tended to elicit greater discrimination of juvenile-and mature-stage growth by mammals than plants grown in more moderate climates. Further evidence for biogeographical variation in mammalian consumption came from 14 feeding studies, including 6 plant and 6 mammal species, that compared conspecific plants of the juvenile growth stage either grown or collected at different localities. In 86% of the studies, extent of herbivory by mammals varied inversely with latitude, and this yielded a moderate effect (Z 0.46, r 0.53). We discuss potential roles of life history, climate, and historical association of plants and mammals in shaping these biogeographical patterns.},

   abstract = {Herbivory can shape the dynamics of plant populations, including effects on survival and reproduction, and is in turn affected by environmental factors that vary in space and time. White-tailed deer are significant herbivores in North America that have been broadly documented to affect plant reproductive success. If variation in the frequency and impact of herbivory by deer correlates with a broad-scale latitudinal gradient, climactic effects may be important for shaping plant-herbivore interactions. Alternatively, a lack of broad-scale gradients would suggest local factors such as plant community composition and deer densities are affecting herbivory. To investigate broad-scale patterns of deer herbivory, we examined the frequency and reproductive consequences of deer browse over three years in 17 populations of Campanulastrum americanum spanning the latitudinal extent of its range. Even though deer are overabundant throughout the range of C. americanum, we found spatiotemporal variation in deer browse frequency (0-0.96, mean 0.46) and its effects on plant reproductive success. The four southernmost populations experienced high levels of herbivory, and were responsible for generating a negative relationship between latitude and herbivory. In general, patterns of variation in the frequency and impact of herbivory across the entire latitudinal gradient pointed to the importance of local rather than broad-scale factors. Within a population, deer consumed larger plants. Across many populations and years, average fitnesses of browsed and uneaten plants were similar, suggesting that plants are tolerant to browse. However, since large plants have greater reproductive success and are more likely to be browsed, tolerance may be influenced by plant size. When plant size was accounted for, most populations did not fully compensate for browsing. There was no relationship between browsing intensity and tolerance, suggesting that browsing may be too variable to consistently select for tolerance, or that increases in deer density are too recent for increased tolerance to evolve.},

   abstract = {A new approach for studying browsing impact on the regeneration of rowan (Sorbus aucuparia L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) is presented. This approach can be a useful, complementary tool to damage surveys because it helps to identify possible underestimation of damage in cases where the most palatable species are likely to have completely disappeared due to browsing. The impact of wild ungulates on the height structures of the populations of these two species was studied at four sites in the Trentino area (Italy). The recorded height structures (affected by ungulate browsing) were compared with predicted structures and then residuals were calculated from power function models. The residuals of the most palatable species (rowan) showed that in all study sites there is a decrease in regeneration individuals in the height classes most affected by browsing. Indeed, the greater the density of wild ungulates, the greater the decrease, and in the site with the highest density (Paneveggio), there is a total absence of rowan individuals with a height between 100 and 160 cm. On the contrary, among the Norway spruce we did not observe a high number of residuals in the height classes affected by browsing. In order to better define the temporal dimensions of the browsing, a dendroecological study was conducted. Abrupt growth releases in the tree rings indicate exactly when the leader of a single tree escapes from intense browsing. An abrupt growth release chronology for each site and each species was thus constructed and the differences, in terms of the length and intensity of browsing, were evidenced. The dendroecological study did not show particular differences in the temporal distribution of abrupt growth releases in the Norway spruce, whereas it did show a significant difference for the rowan between the first three study sites and the Paneveggio site. After 1985, no further releases from suppression were observed in Paneveggio and we can therefore hypothesize that following that date, the browsing was so intense that it prevented any rowan individuals from growing beyond browsing height. The fact is that in Paneveggio, the impact from wild ungulates is splitting the rowan population in two: one part established and grew above browsing height before the recent wild ungulate population increase, while the second is made up of those trees that established after the wild ungulate population explosion and which at the time of measurement had either not yet reached browsing height or had been kept suppressed in the lower vegetation layers by browsing. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

   abstract = {At the core of plant regeneration, temperature and water supply are critical drivers for seed dormancy (initiation, break) and germination. Hence, global climate change is altering these environmental cues and will preclude, delay, or enhance regeneration from seeds, as already documented in some cases. Along with compromised seedling emergence and vigour, shifts in germination phenology will influence population dynamics, and thus, species composition and diversity of communities. Altered seed maturation (including consequences for dispersal) and seed mass will have ramifications on life history traits of plants. Predicted changes in temperature and precipitation, and thus in soil moisture, will affect many components of seed persistence in soil, e.g. seed longevity, dormancy release and germination, and soil pathogen activity. More/less equitable climate will alter geographic distribution for species, but restricted migratory capacity in some will greatly limit their response. Seed traits for weedy species could evolve relatively quickly to keep pace with climate change enhancing their negative environmental and economic impact. Thus, increased research in understudied ecosystems, on key issues related to seed ecology, and on evolution of seed traits in nonweedy species is needed to more fully comprehend and plan for plant responses to global warming. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {Global warming is predicted to dramatically alter communities' composition through differential colonization abilities, such as between sessile plants and their mobile herbivores. Novel interactions between previously non-overlapping species may, however, also be mediated by altered plants' responses to herbivore attack. Syndromes of plant defences and tolerance are driven by inherited functional traits, biotic and abiotic conditions, and the geographical and historical contingencies affecting the community. Therefore, understanding climate change-driven herbivore responses and evolution towards a particular plant defence syndrome is key to forecasting species interactions in the near future. In this paper, we first document variations in herbivory, and plant defences along altitudinal gradients that act as 'natural experiments'. We then use an empirical model to predict how specialist herbivore abundance may shift with respect to elevation in the near future. Our field surveys and field experiment showed a decrease in herbivory with elevation. However, contrary to expectations, our meta-regression analyses showed that plant defences, particularly leaf toughness and flavonoid compounds, tend to be higher at high elevations, while secondary metabolites showed no clear trend with elevation. Based on those results, we discuss how plant communities and species-specific plant defence syndromes will change in response to the climate-driven herbivore colonization of higher altitudes. Particularly, plant from high elevation, due to high protection against abiotic stress may be already ecologically fitted to resist the sudden increase in herbivory pressure that they will likely experience during global change. © 2013 The Authors.

   abstract = {Treelines are advancing on a global scale and encroaching upon alpine ecosystems. Browsing by vertebrate herbivores could affect treeline dynamics and forest expansion by limiting growth of trees. However, this has not been experimentally investigated, and due to a combination of herbivore behaviour and plant responses to herbivory, is unlikely to be a simple relationship. A long term (8 years of manipulation), large scale (0.3km2) sheep enclosure experiment, in the Scandes of Norway, was used to investigate the effect of three densities of sheep (no sheep, low and high densities with respectively 0, 25 and 80sheepkm-2) on tree growth within a mountain birch (Betula pubescens tortuosa) treeline ecotone. Birch trees were most likely to be browsed at intermediate heights of around 100-130cm and the likelihood of an individual being browsed did not differ between low and high sheep densities. However, when browsed, the intensity of browsing increased with sheep density. High densities of sheep reduced the net annual shoot growth of young mountain birch in comparison to growth in the absence of sheep. The long-term height growth of smaller mountain birch (stem diameter<15mm) was also reduced at high densities of sheep, but the height growth of larger birch was resistant to browsing, even though these trees were on average still within browsing height. This study shows that susceptibility to browsing in birch decreases with size, but by restraining the height growth of trees high densities of sheep can keep trees at heights at which they remain susceptible to browsing. Reductions in livestock density over a period as short as 8 years can thus facilitate altitudinal forest expansion. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Plant interactions play a central role in regulating plant communities and this role can be altered by abiotic stress. With increasing stress, ecological theory predicts that the role of competition decreases whilst that of facilitation increases. Such predictions have been tested with short-term plant removal experiments using two distinct indices evaluating the role of plant interactions: the intensity (absolute impact) and the importance (impact relative to that of other abiotic constraints) of plant interactions. Using data on individual tree radial growth from more than 17 000 forest plots covering the habitat conditions of 16 species in the Alps and the Jura mountains of France, we show that non-manipulative estimates of plant interactions provide an alternative to this experimental approach. We developed a Bayesian neighbourhood growth competition model to test theoretical predictions about plant-plant interactions with a much larger spatio-temporal scope and set of study species than classically used in experimental studies of plant-plant interactions. Our analyses revealed that competition - measured as neighbours effects on adult tree growth - varies in importance but not in intensity along two major bioclimatic gradients (degree-day sum and water availability). Observed patterns of competition importance differed between shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant tree species. First, the mean importance of competition was found to be much higher for shade-intolerant species. Second, for shade-intolerant species the importance of competition remained high even at low crowding indices (i.e. at a low competitor density), whereas for shade-tolerant species competition only became important at high crowding indices. Synthesis. Our non-manipulative approach to the study of plant-plant interactions allows analysing interactions among many species over large climatic gradients. Our results clearly demonstrate that a quantitative estimation of density dependence effects is key to understanding how plant-plant interactions vary along abiotic gradients. Growth predictions derived from our model can easily be integrated with other results on tree regeneration and mortality in individual-based models to investigate how plant-plant interactions drive tree population and community dynamics under varying climatic conditions. © 2010 The Authors.

   abstract = {Vegetation at ecotone transitions between open and forested areas is often heavily affected by two key processes: climate change and management of large herbivore densities. These both drive woody plant state shifts, determining the location and the nature of the limit between open and tree or shrub-dominated landscapes. In order to adapt management to prevailing and future climate, we need to understand how browsing and climatic factors together affect the growth of plants at biome borders. To disentangle herbivory and climate effects, we combined long-term tree growth monitoring and dendroecology to investigate woody plant growth under different temperatures and red deer (Cervus elaphus) herbivory pressures at forest–moorland ecotones in the Scottish highlands. Reforestation and deer densities are core and conflicting management concerns in the area, and there is an urgent need for additional knowledge. We found that deer herbivory and climate had significant and interactive effects on tree growth: in the presence of red deer, pine (Pinus sylvestris) growth responded more strongly to annual temperature than in the absence of deer, possibly reflecting differing plant–plant competition and facilitation conditions. As expected, pine growth was negatively related to deer density and positively to temperature. However, at the tree population level, warming decreased growth when more than 60% of shoots were browsed. Heather (Calluna vulgaris) growth was negatively related to temperature and the direction of the response to deer switched from negative to positive when mean annual temperatures fell below 6.0°C. In addition, our models allow estimates to be made of how woody plant growth responds under specific combinations of temperature and herbivory, and show how deer management can be adapted to predicted climatic changes in order to more effectively achieve reforestation goals. Our results support the hypothesis that temperature and herbivory have interactive effects on woody plant growth, and thus accounting for just one of these two factors is insufficient for understanding plant growth mechanics at biome transitions. Furthermore, we show that climate-driven woody plant growth increases can be negated by herbivory.},

   abstract = {1. There are conflicting reports concerning the adaptive features of tree populations originating from cold, high-altitude environments. We hypothesize that such trees will possess adaptive features that will be demonstrated in a common environment, such as elevated rates of net CO 2 exchange, elevated needle nitrogen concentration and high proportional biomass allocation to roots. To test this hypothesis we measured tree and seed properties of 54 populations of Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst.] located along eight altitudinal transects (from c. 600 to 1500 m) in southern Poland. We also measured growth, biomass partitioning, net photosynthetic capacity (A max), needle dark respiration (RS) and carbohydrate, nitrogen (N) and chlorophyll concentration of seedlings originating from these populations grown for 2 to 7 years in a common garden at 150 m elevation. Measured in situ along the elevational transects, there were linear declines in seed mass, average d.b.h. and height growth increment of seed trees with increased altitude or lower mean annual temperature. 2. In the common garden, the Norway spruce populations from colder, high-altitude habitats had higher N concentration in needles than those from low altitudes. Both A max and needle RS increased with altitude of seed origin and were significantly related to needle N concentration. High-altitude populations also had higher concentrations of chlorophyll and carotene than those from low elevations. Despite higher photosynthetic rates in high-altitude populations, seedling height and dry mass in the common garden declined with altitude of seed origin. Proportional dry mass partitioning to roots nearly doubled with increasing altitude of origin, while the length of the shoot-growth period was reduced. The high respiration rates, high allocation to roots and reduced shoot-growth period are probably responsible for the low growth rate potential of high-altitude populations, more than offsetting their higher photosynthetic rates. 3. The results of this study showed that Norway spruce populations from cold mountain environments are characterized by several potentially adaptive features. Because these were similar to conifer population responses along a latitudinal gradient of origin, they are probably driven by climate. These climate-driven differences were common to all transects: for a given altitude or mean annual temperature, plant traits were independent of mountain range of origin. However, populations originating from cold high-elevation sites often differed per unit change in altitude or mean annual temperature more than did low elevation populations. The scaling of nitrogen, CO 2 exchange and biomass and allocation patterns may be useful in modelling Norway spruce response on montane forest ecosystems under changing environments.},

Methods: An extensive systematic review of the current literature on the attractant-decoy and repellent-plant hypotheses was done to describe the following attributes of the research to date: (i) the geographic extent (country and biome) of studies on this topic, (ii) the scope of experimental designs used, (iii) the level of support for these hypotheses with respect to the breadth of ecological niches tested, (iv) the level of support for these hypotheses with respect to the classes of herbivores examined and, lastly, (v) the ecological impact or purpose of these studies. Herein, we summarize important research gaps in the empirical literature on this topic and identify novel opportunities for critical linkages between ecological and applied theories. Important Findings: A total of 37% of experiments testing these two associated hypotheses were done in North America, frequently in either temperate broadleaf (26% of studies) or taiga ecosystems (15% of studies). The majority of these studies involved experimental manipulations such as removing and transplanting vegetation and either tracked or excluded mammalian herbivores. Ecological implications were primarily examined (59% of studies), but there were also implications described for agriculture and commercial forestry in 22% of studies. The repellent-plant hypothesis was well supported in many ecological systems, particularly for mammalian herbivores, but the attractant-decoy hypothesis has been less frequently tested, thereby representing an important research gap. Insect herbivores were under-represented in all categories except in applied contexts such as commercial forestry and agriculture. There is a clear need for studies to connect these two ecological hypotheses with the management of agriculture and restoration efforts in many ecosystems. Research on the co-evolution and facilitation between palatable and unpalatable plants also represents another novel area of future study.},

   abstract = {Northern forest ecosystems are projected to experience warmer growing seasons, as well as winters with reduced snowpack depth and duration. Reduced snowpack will expose soils to cold winter air and lead to increased frequency of freeze-thaw cycles. The interactions between warmer soils in the growing season and colder soils in winter may have important implications for the phenology, productivity and nutrient content of forest plants. We conducted an experiment at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH, USA, to examine the effects of growing season warming, reduced depth and duration of winter snowpack, as well as increased frequency of soil freeze-thaw cycles on sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and red maple (Acer rubrum) saplings. We examined the direct effects of soil temperatures on plant root health, timing of leaf-out, foliar nitrogen, rates of photosynthesis and growth, as well as the indirect effects of snowpack reduction on herbivory on plant stems. A smaller winter snowpack and increased frequency of soil freeze-thaw cycles in winter led to increased root damage and delayed leaf-out for maple saplings. Snowpack reduction decreased rates of stem herbivory in winter, indicating that alleviation of above-ground stem damage in winters with reduced snowpack may offset the root damage incurred from successive soil freeze-thaw cycles in winters with low snowpack. Synthesis. By examining the response of two dominant tree species to simulated climate change in both the growing season and winter, we find that plant responses are mediated through a combination of changes in soil temperature and plant–herbivore interactions that differentially affect above- and below-ground plant components. These results highlight the feedbacks between trophic levels that shape forest function and demonstrate the need for considering climate change across seasons in global change experiments to determine how forest function may change in the future.},

Willow (Salix spp.) shrubs are important constituents of alpine ecosystems, influencing community structure and providing habitat and forage for many species. We investigate the impact of browsing by domestic sheep (Ovis aries), the dominant herbivore in Norwegian mountains, on Salix stem density, height, and radial growth. We used a field experiment, replicated along an elevational gradient, with manipulated densities of sheep (no sheep, low density, and high density at 0, 25, and 80 sheep km-2). We found that Salix shoot density and radial growth were greatest at high sheep density but only at low elevations, indicating that competition from field-layer vegetation at lower sheep densities reduced Salix performance. At higher elevations Salix shoot density and radial growth were lower at high sheep density than at low sheep density and in the absence of sheep. Thus at high elevations sheep browsing is likely to slow the expansion of Salix shrubs, whilst the removal of browsing is likely to constrain Salix expansion at lower elevations.},

   abstract = {The treeline ecotone divides forest from open alpine or arctic vegetation states. Treelines are generally perceived to be temperature limited. The role of herbivores in limiting the treeline is more controversial, as experimental evidence from relevant large scales is lacking. Here we quantify the impact of different experimentally controlled herbivore densities on the recruitment and survival of birch Betula pubescens tortuosa along an altitudinal gradient in the mountains of southern Norway. After eight years of summer grazing in large-scale enclosures at densities of 0, 25, and 80 sheep/km 2 , birch recruited within the whole altitudinal range of ungrazed enclosures, but recruitment was rarer in enclosures with low-density sheep and was largely limited to within the treeline in enclosures with high-density sheep. In contrast, the distribution of saplings (birch older than the experiment) did not differ between grazing treatments, suggesting that grazing sheep primarily limit the establishment of new tree recruits rather than decrease the survival of existing individuals. This study provides direct experimental evidence that herbivores can limit the treeline below its potential at the landscape scale and even at low herbivore densities in this climatic zone. Land use changes should thus be considered in addition to climatic changes as potential drivers of ecotone shifts.},

Persistent seedling and sapling banks of beech and other shade tolerant species often play a major role in canopy gap closure. To gain more insight into interactions between medium-sized gaps and pre-gap ground vegetation patterns, we studied beech regeneration over a 10-year period on a site rich in wild garlic (Allium ursinum L.) in a Dinaric beech old-growth forest. In 1999 we selected the five largest newly created gaps (∼200m2) and systematically established 13 permanent plots (1×2m) in each gap. In 1999, 2004, and 2009, we sampled tree species regeneration (density, cover, and growth), ground vegetation (composition and cover), and light climate. Beech regeneration slowly increased in density and cover despite an overall decrease in light (11.0-5.7%). The same was not true for maple. While beech was present in all regeneration classes, dominant maple seedlings rarely reached 50cm. Beech also had a significantly greater height increment. Regeneration of both species was negatively affected by Allium cover, low light levels, and ungulate browsing. Gap partitioning was observed among shade tolerant Allium, which preferred microsites under closed canopy and low light levels, beech regeneration, which preferred gap periphery, and other less shade tolerant herbs, which favoured gap centres. The slow development of the regeneration indicated the importance of several gap releases. The high maple seedling density and less abundant beech advance regeneration in this study site compared to other beech sites suggests that Allium dominated managed forests might present an opportunity for growing less shade-tolerant species, if managed with a gap-oriented silvicultural system (e.g. irregular shelterwood). © 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

As a default choice, we recommend the Cauchy distribution with center 0 and scale 2.5, which in the simplest setting is a longer-tailed version of the distribution attained by assuming one-half additional success and one-half additional failure in a logistic regression. Cross-validation on a corpus of datasets shows the Cauchy class of prior distributions to outperform existing implementations of Gaussian and Laplace priors. We recommend this prior distribution as a default choice for routine applied use. It has the advantage of always giving answers, even when there is complete separation in logistic regression (a common problem, even when the sample size is large and the number of predictors is small), and also automatically applying more shrinkage to higher-order interactions. This can be useful in routine data analysis as well as in automated procedures such as chained equations for missing-data imputation. We implement a procedure to fit generalized linear models in R with the Student-t prior distribution by incorporating an approximate EM algorithm into the usual iteratively weighted least squares. We illustrate with several applications, including a series of logistic regressions predicting voting preferences, a small bioassay experiment, and an imputation model for a public health data set. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics.},

We suggest that, similar to the manifold that tree species leaf traits cluster around the 'leaf economics spectrum', a similar 'wood economics spectrum' may be defined.

   abstract = {[[p. 209]] Becoming acquainted with tropical nature is, before all else, a great esthetic experience. Plants and animals of temperate lands seem to us somehow easy to live with, and this is not only because many of them are long familiar. Their style is for the most part subdued, delicate, often almost inhibited. Many of them are subtly beautiful; others are plain; few are flamboyant. In contrast, tropical life seems to have flung all restraints to the winds. It is exuberant, luxurious, flashy, often even gaudy, full of daring and abandon, but first and foremost enormously tense and powerful. Watching the curved, arched, contorted, spirally wound, and triumphantly vertical stems and trunks of trees and lianas in forests of Rio Negro and the Amazon, it often occurred to me that modern art has missed a most bountiful source of inspiration. The variety of lines and forms in tropical forests surely exceeds what all surrealists together have been able to dream of, and many of these lines and forms are endowed with dynamism and with biological meaningfulness that are lacking, so far as I am able to perceive, in the creations exhibited in museums of modern art. Tropical rainforest impresses even a casual observer by the enormity of the mass of protoplasm arising from its soil. The foliage of the trees makes a green canopy high above the ground. Lianas, epiphytes, relatively scarce undergrowth of low trees and shrubs, and, finally, many fungi and algae form several layers of vegetational cover. Of course, tropical lands are not all overgrown with impenetrable forests and not all teeming with strange-looking beasts. One of the most perfect deserts in the world lies between the equator and the Tropic of Capricorn, in Peru and northern Chile. Large areas of the Amazon and Orinoco watersheds, both south and north of the equator, are savannas, some of them curiously akin to southern Arizona and Sonora in type of landscape. But regardless of the mass of living matter per unit area, tropical life is impressive in its endless variety and exuberance. Since the animals and plants which exist in the world are products of the evolutionary development of living matter, any differences between tropical and temperate organisms must be the outcome of differences in evolutionary patterns. What causes have brought about [[p. 210]] the greater richness and variety of the tropical faunas and floras, compared to faunas and floras of temperate and, especially, of cold lands? How does life in tropical environments influence the evolutionary potentialities of the inhabitants? Should the tropical zone be regarded as an evolutionary cradle of new types of organization which sends out migrants to colonize the extratropical world? Or do the tropics serve as sanctuary for evolutionary old age where organisms that were widespread in the geological past survive as relics? These and related problems have never been approached from the standpoint of modern conceptions of the mechanism of evolutionary process. Temperate faunas and floras, and species domesticated by or associated with man, have supplied, up to now, practically all the material for studies on population genetics and genetical ecology.},

   abstract = {Ecological interactions may vary geographically as a function of diversity, density, or per capita interaction strengths, but we know little about the relative importance of these three mechanisms. We examined variation in species richness, abundance, and interactions among leaf-chewing herbivores and the dominant salt-marsh plant Spartina alterniflora along the Atlantic Coast of the United States. High-latitude S. alterniflora plants are more palatable to herbivores than are low-latitude plants. Within this range of latitude, diversity and density of the dominant leaf-chewing consumers, snails and grasshoppers, in Spartina-dominated portions of the marsh varied little. Low-latitude plants, however, experienced much greater levels of leaf damage from consumers than did high-latitude plants. Per capita feeding rates of low-latitude snails (Littoraria irrorata) and grasshoppers (Or-chelimum fidicinum) in the laboratory were greater than feeding rates of high-latitude snails (Melampus bidentatus) and grasshoppers (Conocephalus spartinae). In field experiments, low-latitude snails strongly suppressed S. alterniflora growth, but high-latitude snails had no effect on primary production. Thus, latitudinal differences in the effect of herbivores on plants (i.e., interaction strength), driven by differences in per capita effects among species, rather than differences in diversity or density, may contribute to selection for latitudinal differences in plant palatability. Because geographical differences in interaction strength can occur in the absence of differences in diversity or density, linking biogeography with community ecology will require experimental studies that explicitly measure interaction strength at multiple geographic locations.},

   abstract = {Lack of information on ecological characteristics of species across different continents hinders development of general world-scale quantitative vegetation dynamic models. We constructed common scales of shade, drought, and waterlogging tolerance for 806 North American, European/West Asian, and East Asian temperate shrubs and trees representing about 40% of the extant natural Northern Hemisphere species pool. These scales were used to test the hypotheses that shade tolerance is negatively related to drought and waterlogging tolerances, and that these correlations vary among continents and plant functional types. We observed significant negative correlations among shade and drought tolerance rankings for all data pooled, and separately for every continent and plant functional type, except for evergreen angiosperms. Another significant trade-off was found for drought and waterlogging tolerance for all continents, and for evergreen and deciduous angiosperms, but not for gymnosperms. For all data pooled, for Europe and East Asia, and for evergreen and deciduous angiosperms, shade tolerance was also negatively associated with waterlogging tolerance. Quantile regressions revealed that the negative relationship between shade and drought tolerance was significant for species growing in deep to moderate shade and that the negative relationship between shade and waterlogging tolerance was significant for species growing in moderate shade to high light, explaining why all relationships between different tolerances were negative according to general regression analyses. Phylogenetic signal in the tolerance to any one of the three environmental factors studied was significant but low, with only 21-24% of cladogram nodes exhibiting significant conservatism. The inverse relationships between different tolerances were significant in phylogenetically independent analyses both for the overall pool of species and for two multispecies genera (Pinus and Quercus) for which reliable molecular phylogenies were available. Only 2.6-10.3% of the species were relatively tolerant to two environmental stresses simultaneously (tolerance value !3), and only three species were tolerant to all three stresses, supporting the existence of functional trade-offs in adjusting to multiple environmental limitations. These trade-offs represent a constraint for niche differentiation, reducing the diversity of plant responses to the many combinations of irradiance and water supply that are found in natural ecosystems.},

   abstract = {Motivation: Trait data are fundamental to the quantitative description of plant form and function. Although root traits capture key dimensions related to plant responses to changing environmental conditions and effects on ecosystem processes, they have rarely been included in large-scale comparative studies and global models. For instance, root traits remain absent from nearly all studies that define the global spectrum of plant form and function. Thus, to overcome conceptual and methodological roadblocks preventing a widespread integration of root trait data into large-scale analyses we created the Global Root Trait (GRooT) Database. GRooT provides ready-to-use data by combining the expertise of root ecologists with data mobilization and curation. Specifically, we (a) determined a set of core root traits relevant to the description of plant form and function based on an assessment by experts, (b) maximized species coverage through data standardization within and among traits, and (c) implemented data quality checks. Main types of variables contained: GRooT contains 114,222 trait records on 38 continuous root traits. Spatial location and grain: Global coverage with data from arid, continental, polar, temperate and tropical biomes. Data on root traits were derived from experimental studies and field studies. Time period and grain: Data were recorded between 1911 and 2019. Major taxa and level of measurement: GRooT includes root trait data for which taxonomic information is available. Trait records vary in their taxonomic resolution, with subspecies or varieties being the highest and genera the lowest taxonomic resolution available. It contains information for 184 subspecies or varieties, 6,214 species, 1,967 genera and 254 families. Owing to variation in data sources, trait records in the database include both individual observations and mean values. Software format: GRooT includes two csv files. A GitHub repository contains the csv files and a script in R to query the database.},

   abstract = {Increasing durations and frequencies of droughts under climate change endanger the sustainable functioning of forests worldwide. The admixture of species with complementary resource use may increase the resilience of forests towards drought; however, little is known about modifications of species interactions (i.e. facilitation and competition) by increasing drought severity in mixed forests. In particular, knowledge on the regulation of central ecohydrological processes, such as tree water fluxes, is lacking. Therefore, we conducted a literature review to assess the impact of species interactions on tree resilience (resistance + recovery) under increasing drought severity. The classification of studies into three drought classes suggested that beneficial species interactions, i.e. through improved water relations, were prevalent under mild droughts. However, with increasing drought, negative effects, such as interspecific competition, occurred. These negative interactions were prominent under extreme droughts, where even trees with complementary resource-use strategies competed for water resources. Fewer data are available on recovery of water fluxes. The limited evidence supported the patterns observed for drought resistance, with facilitation and complementarity of species in mixtures enhancing tree recovery after moderate droughts. However, after extreme droughts, competition effects and reduced recovery for some species were observed, which can strongly compromise tree resilience. While we acknowledge the importance of mixed forests for biodiversity, ecosystem services or pest resistance, we caution that beneficial species interactions may shift under extreme droughts. Thus, there is an urgent need to investigate species interaction effects on resilience in more depth to adapt forest trees to increasing drought stress.},

This focus collection illustrates a variety of methods in measuring and modeling tree-mortality, and adds significant new research findings into the scientific literature on tree mortality from hotter droughts.

   abstract = {Tree mortality is an important process in forest ecosystems, frequently hypothesized to be highly climate sensitive. Yet, tree death remains one of the least understood processes of forest dynamics. Recently, changes in tree mortality have been observed in forests around the globe, which could profoundly affect ecosystem functioning and services provisioning to society. We describe continental-scale patterns of recent tree mortality from the only consistent pan-European forest monitoring network, identifying recent mortality hotspots in southern and northern Europe. Analyzing 925,462 annual observations of 235,895 trees between 2000 and 2012, we determine the influence of climate variability and tree age on interannual variation in tree mortality using Cox proportional hazard models. Warm summers as well as high seasonal variability in precipitation increased the likelihood of tree death. However, our data also suggest that reduced cold-induced mortality could compensate increased mortality related to peak temperatures in a warming climate. Besides climate variability, age was an important driver of tree mortality, with individual mortality probability decreasing with age over the first century of a trees life. A considerable portion of the observed variation in tree mortality could be explained by satellite-derived net primary productivity, suggesting that widely available remote sensing products can be used as an early warning indicator of widespread tree mortality. Our findings advance the understanding of patterns of large-scale tree mortality by demonstrating the influence of seasonal and diurnal climate variation, and highlight the potential of state-of-the-art remote sensing to anticipate an increased likelihood of tree mortality in space and time.},

Yet, climate-induced tree mortality and biotic disturbance agents are largely absent from process-based ecosystem models. Using data sets from the western USA and associated studies, we present a framework for determining the relative contribution of drought stress, insect attack, and their interactions, which is critical for modeling mortality in future climates. We outline a simple approach that identifies the mechanisms associated with two guilds of insects - bark beetles and defoliators - which are responsible for substantial tree mortality. We then discuss cross-biome patterns of insect-driven tree mortality and draw upon available evidence contrasting the prevalence of insect outbreaks in temperate and tropical regions. We conclude with an overview of tools and promising avenues to address major challenges. Ultimately, a multitrophic approach that captures tree physiology, insect populations, and tree-insect interactions will better inform projections of forest ecosystem responses to climate change.},
